In this challenge, we provide funding for people who have learned about Cardano to take advantage of the community&rsquo;s support and build on or use the Cardano network.</p><p>The nature of the proposals for this challenge is open-ended. Their only requirement is to originate or focus on East Asia and include east Asian team members or focus on East Asian participants.</p><p>For instance, the overwhelming majority of Stake Pools reside in North America and Europe. The Cardano network will be more resilient when Stake Pools are evenly distributed across the globe. The Catalyst community needs to step up and intentionally make that happen.</p><p>Cardano started life in East Asia (Japan and Hong Kong), and Emurgo focuses on East Asia. Let&rsquo;s build upon that.</p><h2 id=what-this-is>What this is:</h2><p>A call to action; Activate the Cardano community&rsquo;s ability to recognise, reward the opportunity to make the world a better place. East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.</p><p>Addressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.</p><p>It is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. When the challenge succeeds, the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the benefits many of us were born with—allowing others with fewer privileged circumstances to rise and succeed.</p><h2 id=challenge-team>Challenge Team</h2><p>This proposal seeks to include a challenge team. Unfortunately, the proposer&rsquo;s have not had time to fully form a challenge team before the proposal goes into review.

We want to build a truly global economy and society. Our focus is on making the hard, possible. A place, a time, and a space where:</p><ul><li>We can build knowledge, share information, connect and support each other.</li><li>Language and culture are not an barrier to participation.</li><li>We learn how to apply the technology, and community, to address local needs.</li><li>Show how to use Cardano to increase our economic wellbeing.</li><li>Enrich Cardano&rsquo;s ecosystem with our stories, our energy, and our perspectives.</li></ul><p>The eastern hemisphere, East and Southeast Asia region unite culturally and linguistically a lot of countries. With a population of over 1.6 Billion, our goal is to grow Cardano.</p><h3 id=current-problems-and-limitation>Current Problems and Limitation</h3><p>The Eastern Townhall is the result of individuals and groups working together. Each bringing a unique quality. We interact in and around the Cardano Community, focused on linking individuals and projects to Project Catalyst. But this takes time, effort, and incurs expenses. Having no pool of funds to draw upon limits what we can achieve.</p><h3 id=proposed-solution-pool-of-funds>Proposed Solution: Pool of Funds</h3><p>To reach a global audience means meeting people where they are, in their country, their language and their culture.</p><p>We are an active part of our Cardano ecosystem. Our cornerstone event is the weekly Eastern Townhalls. But we are doing more, so much more:</p><ul><li>We make knowledge and content accessible to as many cultures as possible.</li><li>We host different events where community members come together</li><li>We bridges to underrepresented groups</li><li>We integrate local perspectives to enrich the Catalyst Community; and</li><li>We listen! Gathering opinions and data to help us all understand.</li></ul><p><strong>We are doing translations, building community, sharing knowledge, enabling entrepreneurs, and growing Cardano.</strong></p><p>Doing all that has costs, so if we are to sustain the Eastern Townhall efforts, then we need to secure funding in a way that does not add extra effort to what we are already doing.</p><p>This proposal is about forming and maintain a pool of funds (a treasury) that is managed by the Eastern Townhall Trusted Seed. A pool of funds to spend at our discretion. The treasury will be used to cover expenses, to grow and sustain the efforts of the Eastern Townhall. Expenses like translation bounties; production of content; paying for online service subscriptions such as Zoom, Github, HackMD, Statbot and others; paying for activities related to organising the Eastern Town Hall.</p><p>Simply put this proposal is about funds for organising a community group. Establishing a resource and distributed support structure that provides funds needed on demand without the overhead of specific Catalyst proposals.</p><p>In return, we promise to report back financial statements on our activities and expenses. Translated into as many languages as we can find collaborators for. Our intent is to pioneer and prototype DAO treasury management[3] reporting. That is not a small matter and managing a shared pool of funds has plenty of compliance complications. The reporting effort is Similar in principal to the work being done by index.coop[4] and FWB[5]. Most DAOs are still figuring this out and the best practices are not even drafts, so help us work this out.</p><p>Learning how the Eastern Town Hall is spending and allocating funds will help us attract future funding. Help collaborators identify opportunities to work with us.</p><p>Help us scale and reach more people across the Eastern Hemisphere.</p><h3 id=kpi-measurement-method-and-goals>KPI measurement method and goals</h3><p>A questionnaire on the number of proposers / voters / advisors is conducted for each <strong>fund</strong> in the community of the target country.

Meet them where they are, in their country, their language and their culture. The Eastern Townhall wants to establish a growing network of East Asian entrepreneurs. Where they can build knowledge, share information, connect and support each other. Thinking global, acting local.</p><h3 id=current-problems-and-limitation>Current Problems and Limitation</h3><p>Recall a moment when you realised if you poked something, pushed it or moulded it, something new and interesting popped out the other side. We&rsquo;re here again and this time on a global scale. We, the Cardano Catalyst community are pioneers in a new mindset. A new way of governing and funding. But to make a dent in the universe we need entrepreneurs. People are willing to take a risk, to poke, to push, and to mould new ways of doing.</p><p>Reaching Entrepreneurs is difficult when language and cultural barriers exist. Local context may also have undeveloped startup funding programmes too. This can result in unrealized startup funding opportunities. Few East Asian entrepreneurs are aware of the opportunities and the technical, economic benefits of Cardano; Nor is there a full understanding of how to apply Cardano technology within local communities to address local market opportunities. We want to change that.</p><h3 id=proposed-solution-cardano-startup-month>Proposed Solution: Cardano StartUp Month</h3><p>This proposal is about running virtual events in January/February 2022 to develop entrepreneurs in Vietnam and Indonesia. The event aims to upskill entrepreneurs to develop market opportunities based on Cardano.</p><p><strong>The purpose of the event is to build startup founders and Distributed Autonomous Organisation (DAO) collaborators.</strong> We are not building startups! Our intent is to educate. Focusing on experience-based learning by providing a soft way for the general public to access entrepreneurship and blockchain technology without risk.</p><p>The event will happen over four weeks:</p><p><strong>Virtual Networking (Week 1 & 2):</strong> The first two weeks of the event is about Networking. Getting registered participants to meet each other, discuss their ideas and aspirations. Tutorial sessions will be held to help upskill and familiarise people with business design tools.</p><p><strong>Pitch and Team-Up (Start of Week 3):</strong> All participants come together for the opening event where individual participants can give a 60-second pitch of a project idea they want to pursue. People vote with their feet by choosing to join a team.</p><p><strong>Learn and Work (Week 3 & 4)</strong>: Over the next two weeks, teams start working together. Mentors are assigned. Special sessions are run with experts. Teams are encouraged to validate their ideas with potential customers. Throughout the two weeks, each team will have four 30min pitch sessions with a panel of mentors that help them refine their pitch and Catalyst Proposal.</p><p><strong>Pitch (End of Week 4)</strong>: All participants come together for the closing event. The pitch! Each team is given five minutes to present their market problem and their solution to a panellist that ask questions. To pitch every team must have submitted their proposal to Catalyst. When all presentations are given the audience will pick the winning teams. Prizes will be awarded. We all celebrate! At the conclusion of Fund 8, Catalyst Voters choose who to fund.</p><p>The event will focus on Cardano Blockchain solutions and place emphasis on using Business Model Generation, Customer Development approaches and the use of analytical tools like Lean Startup, the Platform Design Toolkit, and Wardley Mapping.</p><p>By the time proposals are submitted in Fund 8, entrepreneurial teams will have formed, worked together, finished customer testing, and developed robust business models.</p><h3 id=what-success-looks-like>What Success Looks Like</h3><p>The event is planned to finish on conclusion of the second week of Catalyst fund 8, Feburary 2022. Teams will be submitting proposals to Catalyst Fund 8 as part of their work.</p><p>At the end of the event, at least 15 teams have managed to complete the process and submitted proposals to Catalyst Fund 8.

Now imagine how difficult it must be when you do not speak English. All Ada holders benefit if we develop better more inclusive and diverse governance processes and strategies. Unless the Catalyst Community and Ada holders level up our collective cognition, a random voting strategy is just as valid as a well researched one.</p><h3 id=current-problems-and-limitation>Current Problems and Limitation</h3><p>Language differences and cultural exclusivity prevents governance initiatives from scaling globally. The constant experimentation of Catalyst means we need to be mindful to include different languages and cultures. Avoiding one culture dominating the narrative.</p><p>Misaligned incentives, scams and information overload prevent Ada holders from voting. In Asia and other non-native English speaking cultures, language barriers compound this. Language barriers are evident at every Catalyst stage. Survey results showed in the Japanese community biggest problem of Catalyst voting was the lack of Japanese support (45.61%). Over %37 of respondents highlighted issues with understanding the process- &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand the meaning because it was in English, so I voted randomly&rdquo;. The weariness of scams and lack of trust between proposals and voters were highlighted too. Another %16 mentioned incentive misalignment issues.</p><h3 id=our-solution-eastern-townhall-goverance-forum>Our solution: Eastern Townhall Goverance Forum</h3><p>Our goal is to establish a process, format, and event stage for voter and proposer onboarding. To bring voters, proposers, and proposals closer together. To establish trust between them. The focus is on six mutually reinforcing areas:</p><ol><li><strong>Content production</strong>: Help Ada holders understanding why it is important to vote on proposals.</li><li><strong>Eastern Hemisphere Language-specific events</strong> focused on voter education and discussion.</li><li>A proposal <strong>language translation pipeline</strong> to help proposers reach the wider East Asian community.</li><li><strong>Language-specific Catalyst Swarm Ideafests</strong> as a stage for building voter awareness, engagement, and trust.</li><li><strong>Social Media Marketing</strong>: socialise voter content and messaging across our social media channels; and</li><li>Conduct <strong>routine surveys and user research</strong> to help understand individual attitudes to Catalyst and proposal formats.</li></ol><p>The proposal is seeking funds to help develop a programme specifically designed to help connect voters with proposals and proposers.</p><p>Together these activities form a programme we call the <strong>Eastern Townhall Forum</strong>. Our cornerstone event is the weekly Eastern Townhalls. But we are doing more. We are doing translations, building community, sharing knowledge, educating, enabling entrepreneurs, and growing Cardano.</p><p>The Eastern Townhall trusted seed are an active part of our Cardano ecosystem. Listening and engaging with members of the community. Sharing what we learn. For instance <strong>Yuta Yuta</strong> recently completed one of his many surveys of the Japanese community[1] that this proposal draws upon. We want to do more of this across all the communities. We would like to help improve the user experience for voters. Feeding our collective insights back into Project Catalyst.</p><p>Help us improve decision making across the Eastern Hemisphere by making Catalyst voting more accessible.</p><h2 id=what-success-looks-like>What Success Looks Like</h2><p>Participation in Eastern Townhall events has increased and maintains the vibrancy of the new and regular community members. More Catalyst proposers engage with the Asian community. Even if that is just translation of proposals, content, or DApps for the Asian markets. Additionally, Asian proposers find their crowd. They are able to be funded because there is a strong body of Asian voters participating in Catalyst. Survey results show an increase in voter engagement with proposers, the Catalyst process, and deliberations before voting.</p><h3 id=key-performance-indicators>Key Performance Indicators</h3><p>Our primary tool for measuring performance is our voter survey. We will conduct these on a regular basis across Asian countries. Based on the surveys during and after a fund we expect to:</p><ul><li>Increase Asian voter participation by 30% from the previous funds.</li><li>Increase Asian participation in Catalyst by 20% from the previous fund.</li><li>Uncertainty around Catalyst and voting decreases 25% from the previous fund.</li></ul><p>The Eastern Townhall Meetup is our primary stage where Ada holders and people interested in Cardano can come and meet community members. Through that platform and social media, people learn and feel comfortable going further. Therefore key engagement metrics indicate our success in bridging voters and proposers together:</p><ul><li>The Easter Townhall meetup average weekly numbers increase 25% for each fund.</li><li>Catalyst Proposals available in four languages <em>(ID, JP, KR, VN)</em> increase 50% for each fund.</li><li>Eastern Townhall Social Media accounts increase followers by 1000 new followers in six months.</li></ul><h4 id=after-one-month>After One Month:</h4><ul><li>Completed our first pan-Asia voter survey across four Asian countries <em>(ID, JP, KR, VN)</em></li><li>Language-Specific events – Voter Education & Catalyst Swarm</li></ul><h4 id=after-three-months>After Three Months:</h4><ul><li>Produced our Voter Education videos</li><li>Translated Catalyst voter materials in four Asian languages <em>(ID, JP, KR, VN)</em></li><li>Held the first formal language specific Eastern Townhall - Catalyst Swarm IdeaFests.

We&rsquo;ve tested several translation services such as Crowdin[3], Lokalize[4], PoEditor[5], and GitLozalise[6] for the Eastern Townhall to help us organise and gain some experience.</p><p>Our initial objective is simple: to get a lot of existing Cardano and Catalyst material translated into as many languages of the East and Southeast Asian regions using a semi-automated system. Gaining experience and building community. Documenting what we do and how.</p><p>By semi-automated system, we do not mean machine translation. While Machine translation is helpful as a starting point, it has difficulty with specialised terms and does not read naturally. Human translations will always have a slight advantage. A semi-automated system refers to an ability to queue a piece of work for translation, which may include feeding it through a machine translation service, have it worked on by someone, reviewed, and then published.</p><p>We will start to embrace and extend the excellent localisation documentation processes established by Kubernetes SIG Docs group[7] to help us. Adapting the processes to accommodate the varying technical skills and future directions we want to take.</p><h3 id=work-streams>Work Streams</h3><p>To establish a functioning and sustainable translation pipeline, we are seeking initial funding to help develop the work we have already started. The funding will cover five workstreams:</p><ol><li>Evaluation of translation services and their integration:
with Git, Github, Ideascale, and the Markdown-based documentation efforts of the Cardano Foundation.</li><li>Design, configuration, testing of a translation pipeline:
The goal is to have a small scale process in place that is easy enough to follow and requires minimal supervision.</li><li>Documenting translation process & development of tutorial material:
Embrace and extend the Kubernettes SIG Doc[7] processes to help with our own needs. Developing localised tutorial content to onboard future translators.</li><li>Train the trainers:
Run training sessions with Eastern Townhall members to a level of competence in the process such that they can train others.</li><li>Translations:
Getting up to speed on our workflow is going to require some hands-on tinkering and experience. We aim to translate a selection of Catalyst Guides, Community Advisor, voter education and our own material. That takes time and effort for each language.</li></ol><h3 id=getting-scale-earn-to-learn>Getting Scale: Earn-to-Learn</h3><p>To get true scale, translations and localisation standards, automation, and skills need to be developed so we can outsource localisation to the wider Cardano community. Doing translation and localisation work as a way to get more involved in Cardano and the different communities. Doing translation and localisation work; learning and earning. Doing translation and localisation work to build a reputation and earn Ada. We see a future that leverages Metadata, Native Assets, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), Machine-Learning, and Atala Prism on the Cardano blockchain to give us language and cultural reach. However, starting simply first.</p><h3 id=collaboration>Collaboration</h3><p>Translation and localisation of content is a general issue across many groups working in Cardano and Catalyst. We do not plan to do this work alone or exclusively. In the Eastern Town Hall, we are at the forefront of managing many languages and cultures, our plan is to develop practices and automated processes for our own purposes, and share them widely. Everything we learn and do, we hope will inform the Cardano ecosystem at large.</p><h2 id=what-success-looks-like>What Success Looks Like</h2><p>Near-term the Eastern Townhall is able to translate and host Catalyst Proposals as they are finalised. Translated for our four initial languages in the Asian region. Funded project reports are integrated and translated too. We have also translated, and maintain those translations, of key Cardano and Catalyst documents and guides.</p><p>Mid-term we would like to expand the languages translated, and we are actively working with other groups across the Cardano Ecosystem to do this work.</p><p>Longer-term success means we&rsquo;ve established a whole decentralised workflow for translation and interpretation of any document, video, podcast etc. using the Cardano Network as the coordinating backbone. Where one of the simplest ways to onboard and earn ADA in the Cardano ecosystem system is to help translate, transcribe or interpret material (no harm in dreaming big!).</p><h3 id=key-performance-indicators>Key Performance Indicators</h3><p>Since we are using Git, and Github for the Eastern Townhall planning, organisation, documentation, metrics are derived from Github activity and engagement.</p><p><strong>Key Metric</strong>: Project Velocity[8], defined as a combination of base activity metric of commits and pull-requests taken from Github.</p><p><strong>Activity Metrics</strong>: captured as project activity in Github and cadence documents added and the speed of translation.</p><p><strong>Community Metrics</strong>: engagement behaviours broken down into four categories[9] for the Eastern Townhall website, to measure how our work is being spread and used in the Cardano ecosystem.</p><h3 id=after-one-month>After One Month:</h3><ul><li>Eastern Townhall website information architecture has been developed.</li><li>Primary content for the initial website has been identified and ported to Markdown.</li><li>The entire Eastern Townhall website is translated.</li></ul><h3 id=after-three-months>After Three Months:</h3><ul><li>We have established a semi-automated translation pipeline driven by Git Pull requests.</li><li>Evaluated and tested different translations services as a means to simplify translation.</li><li>Documented our initial translation process and trained the trainers.</li><li>Expanded formats for translations to include video subtitles.</li><li>Issuing NFTs for skills, language, and attribution/contribution tracking.</li></ul><h3 id=after-six-months>After Six Months:</h3><ul><li>On-boarding more members of the Cardano Community to do translations.</li><li>Added two more Eastern hemisphere languages to our core set.</li><li>Tutorial material (documentation and videos) is developed and translated to help onboard new contributors and languages.</li></ul><h3 id=after-twelve-months>After Twelve Months:</h3><ul><li>All Catalyst Proposals and Funded Projects are translated and published within days of being produced.</li><li>We have expanded our core language set to include the ten languages from the Eastern hemisphere.</li><li>The translation project is self-sustaining because projects/teams/businesses want to reach our audience in their native language.</li><li>The Cardano ecosystem coalesce around similar standards for document management and their translations.</li></ul><h3 id=licensing>Licensing</h3><p>All our source code will be licensed under a free and open-source (OSI) license e.g. MIT, and contributions must be contributed patent-free.

In this challenge, we provide funding for people who have learned about Cardano to take advantage of the community&rsquo;s support and build on or use the Cardano network.</p><p>The nature of the proposals for this challenge is open-ended. Their only requirement is to originate or focus on East Asia and include east Asian team members or focus on East Asian participants.</p><p>For instance, the overwhelming majority of Stake Pools reside in North America and Europe. The Cardano network will be more resilient when Stake Pools are evenly distributed across the globe. The Catalyst community needs to step up and intentionally make that happen.</p><p>Cardano started life in East Asia (Japan and Hong Kong), and Emurgo focuses on East Asia. Let&rsquo;s build upon that.</p><h2 id=what-this-is>What this is:</h2><p>A call to action; Activate the Cardano community&rsquo;s ability to recognise, reward the opportunity to make the world a better place. East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.</p><p>Addressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.</p><p>It is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. When the challenge succeeds, the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the benefits many of us were born with—allowing others with fewer privileged circumstances to rise and succeed.</p><h2 id=challenge-team>Challenge Team</h2><p>This proposal seeks to include a challenge team. Unfortunately, the proposer&rsquo;s have not had time to fully form a challenge team before the proposal goes into review.

This challenge, therefore, will determine uptake by adopting some metrics from Decentralised Finance (DeFi) markets as a guide.</p><ul><li>Daily/Monthly Active Wallets (DAW/MAW) - Measure of momentum and engagement</li><li>Average Order Value - Measures who are using services, how much and how often.</li><li>Total Value Locked (TLV) - Measure of confidence in DeFi market protocols.</li><li>Take Rate (Rake) - Measure of efficiency</li><li>Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) - Total value of services transacted.</li></ul><p>We will also be asking some specific questions about the proposals.</p><ul><li>What is the sustainability of proposals beyond the scope of Catalyst?</li><li>Was social and environmental impact evaluation used to measure proposal performance?</li></ul><h2 id=challenge-brief>Challenge brief</h2><p>This challenge is about the ways we can spark a fire under impact investing using the Cardano ecosystem.</p><p>Impact investments are made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside financial returns. While a variety of projects push for the adoption of DeFi on Cardano, can we bring to market the potential of DeFi mechanisms as a vehicle for social good?</p><p>Delivering an outcome that has an impact is a lot harder than just delivering a financial Return-on-Investment, even a small one. Impact investing (according to the World Economic Forum) is hindered by:</p><ul><li>The lack and/or high cost of trustworthy data on the social or environmental results of investment, making credible accounting of impacts difficult.</li><li>Challenges around the “attribution” of impact – meaning the allocation of an impact-related claim to an investor risks “double-counting.”</li><li>Roadblocks in monetizing impacts – illiquid impact markets, uncertain returns, high transaction costs.</li></ul><p>Propose market solutions, financial mechanisms, or means of measuring impact. Think about how these can be deployed at scale to affect positively millions of people. Think about how the results of your proposal can be embedded or reused in different market contexts, or integrated with existing providers.</p><p>Igniting impact investment on Cardano will provide capital to address the world’s most pressing challenges in sectors such as sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, conservation, microfinance, and affordable and accessible basic services including housing, healthcare, and education.</p><p>To achieve impact requires cooperation and collaboration, something Cardano can enable. Could the answer to better managing the world’s resources lie not in government or big investors but instead in technologies that empower peer-to-peer assistance. Community-based finance or data-driven crowdfunding for instance. How can we leverage the awesome power of the Cardano ecosystem to be that catalyst?</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-22bf4a00c74c1f0aac43c6a4bfadffb4>1.3 - Community Proposals</h1><div class=lead>TODO - Customize site navigation and search here.</div><p>This index page is yet to be udated.

As a result, different online merchants, from a small hotel in Europe to a big e-commerce website in Asia, can easily accept hundreds or thousands of ADA transactions when integrating ADA Pay into their site.</p><p>With Catalyst, we are offering an innovative technical challenge to our communities to allow a new and creative way for all small and medium enterprises currently using platforms, such as Shopify and WooCommerce, to readily accept ADA Payments with seamless integration by adding a plug-in into their site.</p><p>In a nutshell, ADA Pay currently provides the ability to send a separate payment request to each payment attempt, allowing merchants to effectively identify each client without requiring the customer&rsquo;s identity before completing the order. In other words, companies integrating ADA Pay enjoy the ability to send a unique address to a potential customer and be notified at every stage of the payment process via Webhook. Moreover, by registering the payment request on the client&rsquo;s backend, merchants can know who pays for what without disclosing the client&rsquo;s information to a third party.</p><p>The teams proceeding with the challenge will be provided with an API Key to the ADA Pay system and complete API documentation of the payment solution. The API Key will allow you to receive and send payments with ADA over the Cardano testnet. The API documentation also includes endpoints to create payment requests, withdraw your funds, and a webhook to notify you of any ongoing activity regarding the payment request.</p><p>With the tools described above, we expect from the teams involved in the challenge to create an innovative plug-in that will be integrated with our current ADA Pay system on the one hand and support all the different e-commerce software mentioned above (Shopify and WooCommerce) on the other.</p><h2 id=how-does-success-look-like>How does success look like?</h2><p>At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves: Do we have a simple, flawless, and easy-to-integrate ADA Pay plug-in solution ready to be integrated into different e-commerce platforms?</p><p>Is the UI and payment flow of the plug-in user-friendly?

Therefore, Cardano and Atala PRISM must include a plan to interact with these other ecosystems to maximize market share.</p><p>We encourage Catalyst proposals to achieve full interoperability.

One of the defining characteristics of these approaches is the creation of alternatives to accredited education and career paths.</p><p>We need our community to think about developing technology and governance primitives to support any community that wants to establish new education and career paths by providing tools:</p><ul><li>For onboarding new experts and teachers</li><li>For people in the community to develop and grow</li><li>For maintaining a reputation as a skilled employee, laborer, consultant, mentor, teacher, etc.</li></ul><p>When reputation standards change, we need ways to self-heal and self-monitor for bad actors, harmful actions, or bad outcomes.</p><h5 id=circular-supply-chain><strong>Circular Supply Chain</strong></h5><p>The global supply chain focuses on creating a new economic infrastructure. The goal is replacing or integrating with legacy systems such as record-keeping, bills of lading, centrally managed systems of record, and distribution networks. Centralization has many challenges, the least of which is a lack of resilience in the global supply chain, as we have all seen and continue to experience in the COVID era.</p><p>Supply chains tend to start as decentralized. Markets and trade routes emerge from the bottom of the producer market and are aggregated into centralized supply chains, eventually working their way down to the consumer. We want to explore new patterns of commerce in bottom-up supply chains that could open and expand the local reputation network into markets that are currently inaccessible, such as:</p><ul><li>Regenerative agriculture</li><li>Locally produced art</li><li>Other forms of local commerce</li></ul><p>On the other side, distribution or demand-driven commerce has the potential to build a market force from the bottom-up that can engage the industrial global supply chain in ways that are not possible without establishing the voice and economic strength of the community digitally.</p><p>For the supply chain challenge, we want to address two significant challenges:</p><h5 id=small-producer-problem>Small Producer Problem</h5><p>How can we create transparency as the bottom-up process meets the industrialized supply chains, cuts through the centralized distribution markets, and connects directly to the consumer?</p><p>For example, small producers like a family ranch in Wyoming have no way to get information about the value of their product through these global aggregation and distribution networks. Currently, a solution such as the <a href=https://beefchain.com/>BeefChain project</a> is supporting small ranchers.</p><p>There are multiple issues to overcome. For example, packaging plants are the entry point to the aggregation, so there is little or no incentive to deal with the small producer. We want to address this problem by building general-purpose tooling to assist communities in self-organizing and self-governing production according to agreed standards. We propose that if these communities can connect and grow, they will either:</p><p>Reach the market through alternative distribution channels to industrial supply chains
Be able to negotiate as a community for better terms to have the values of their products recognized, distributed, and sold with value intact commercially and reputationally.</p><h5 id=the-last-mile-problem>The Last-Mile Problem</h5><p>How can a local distributor in a local market interact with global industrial supply chains and be given access to the market that otherwise would be inaccessible due to a lack of economic identity or capital to access the goods at the scale required by industrial supply chains?</p><p>This challenge deals with distributing necessary products to local communities with little market clout or access to financial tools, such as credit, to interact with the industrial supply chain. We&rsquo;re looking for bottom-up tooling to establish a network of communities. Delegates in those communities can access the finance and credit necessary to interact with the industrial supply chain at the economic scale required for transactions.</p><p>An example of this problem is delivering health care supplies to rural and developing countries and economies. The funds from donors, the government, and other sources are available for these medical supplies. The donors will only release the funds once delivery is verified, and the medical supply companies will only send the goods to port once payment is received.</p><p>However, local small businesses must maintain transparency and oversight of the goods during delivery and receiving. These businesses do not have the funds or the ability to borrow capital to cover medical supplies costs from the delivery at the port to the hospitals and clinics that need them.</p><p>Addressing the challenge of the financial gap is vital. We believe that there is enormous potential to create bottom-up networks of trusted individuals and small businesses to fill this gap.</p><h2 id=why-is-it-important>Why is it Important?</h2><p>How individuals interact with their communities and the broader economy helps us understand which credentials improve their daily lives. By identifying these high-value, high-impact credentials, we can establish governance framework foundries for launching pilot programs and driving growth. Ultimately, this will cause further adoption of Cardano and Atala PRISM technology.</p><h2 id=how-does-success-look-like>How does success look like?</h2><p>Discover repeatable patterns that unlock our ability to leverage the Cardano decentralized infrastructure.

Second layer solutions are also being used as alternatives to Ethereum main chain, Polygon has been a great example.</p><p>In this migration and bridges creation scenario, some projects are turning to Cardano to create their DeFi projects.</p><p>Cardano is finally delivering smart contracts and that opens a door to a lot of innovation in DeFi. We can offer not only a scalable blockchain, but also a secure blockchain and aggregated governance layer in the near future. This set of characteristics place Cardano in a prominent place and with a good opportunity to gain market share and expand the user base.</p><p>With Catalyst, we have the opportunity to fund DeFi projects and allow them to have greater decentralization and resilience, which are essential aspects for DeFi projects. Many projects end up accepting the participation of Venture Capitals due to lack of financial resources. The participation of VCs in DeFi projects usually ends up causing a large part of the supply distribution to be alocated to VCs and this compromises the decentralization and consequently the security of these projects.</p><p>The DeFi ecosystem today is taken over by projects full of vulnerabilities, hacks are constant, economic models are copied from other projects, decentralization is no longer a priority and few projects are dedicated to create economic models/bonding curves/algorithms thinking about the users&rsquo; needs.</p><p>It has become clear over the year that bugs, hacks and vulnerabilities are not unique to smart contracts on Ethereum.

These functionalities should be freely available to all and be owned by the community. Some of these solutions are currently only easily available as Software as a Service solution. If most Dapps are build on top of the same proprietary solutions to access the blockchain, however, this leads to centralization and introduces risk.</p><p>The goal of Cardano is to also include those who are currently being left out. If the best tools build with the community fund are behind a pay wall this creates an unfair playing field. Anyone who wants to start building on top of cardano should be able to easily configure a node with the utilities they need. Anyone who is hosting a node (as SPO or otherwise) should be able to easily add on and offer additional services as they see fit.</p><p>Large scale projects and singular solutions have proven to be inflexible and the industry is focusing on compositional design.

Second layer solutions are also being used as alternatives to Ethereum main chain, Polygon has been a great example.</p><p>In this migration and bridges creation scenario, some projects are turning to Cardano to create their DeFi projects.</p><p>Cardano is finally delivering smart contracts and that opens a door to a lot of innovation in DeFi. We can offer not only a scalable blockchain, but also a secure blockchain and aggregated governance layer in the near future. This set of characteristics place Cardano in a prominent place and with a good opportunity to gain market share and expand the user base.</p><p>With Catalyst, we have the opportunity to fund DeFi projects and allow them to have greater decentralization and resilience, which are essential aspects for DeFi projects. Many projects end up accepting the participation of Venture Capitals due to lack of financial resources. The participation of VCs in DeFi projects usually ends up causing a large part of the supply distribution to be alocated to VCs and this compromises the decentralization and consequently the security of these projects.</p><p>The DeFi ecosystem today is taken over by projects full of vulnerabilities, hacks are constant, economic models are copied from other projects, decentralization is no longer a priority and few projects are dedicated to create economic models/bonding curves/algorithms thinking about the users&rsquo; needs.</p><p>It has become clear over the year that bugs, hacks and vulnerabilities are not unique to smart contracts on Ethereum.

For many reasons, we believe our platform is superior. Therefore, Cardano and Atala PRISM must include a plan to interact with these other ecosystems to maximize market share.</p><p>We encourage Catalyst proposals to achieve full interoperability. Deliverables should optimize the user experience (UX) for Atala PRISM credentials while remaining compatible with other platforms.</p><h3 id=self-governance-of-emergent-communities>Self-governance of Emergent Communities</h3><h5 id=dao-governance-in-practice>DAO Governance in Practice</h5><p>New legislation in Wyoming allows for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to be registered with the state. We challenge the community to establish a DAO under the new laws. It could manage an impact or development goal with shared common resources governed by the DAO.</p><p>We are curious to see if our community proposes a DAO. With a funded proposal, we could facilitate introductions to legal experts in Wyoming.</p><p>The proposal should consider setting aside funds for legal expenses to establish the DAO and legal documentation.</p><h5 id=patterns-of-commoning>Patterns of Commoning</h5><p>We draw inspiration from the work of the Trust Over IP Foundation and the principles from &lsquo;Patterns of Commoning.&rsquo; We see the potential for innovation by linking communities with shared interests under these principles.</p><p>How can these principles become plug-and-play code as technological primitives that other communities can leverage and unlock exponential growth and adoption?</p><p>We are interested in exploring a rich playground of ideas and bringing these to real-world implementations on Cardano and Atala PRISM.</p><h5 id=education-career-and-emergent-reputation-primitives>Education, Career, and Emergent Reputation Primitives</h5><p>Many of our Pioneer and Catalyst-funded projects support education and career programs. One of the defining characteristics of these approaches is the creation of alternatives to accredited education and career paths.</p><p>We need our community to think about developing technology and governance primitives to support any community that wants to establish new education and career paths by providing tools:</p><ul><li>For onboarding new experts and teachers</li><li>For people in the community to develop and grow</li><li>For maintaining a reputation as a skilled employee, laborer, consultant, mentor, teacher, etc.</li></ul><p>When reputation standards change, we need ways to self-heal and self-monitor for bad actors, harmful actions, or bad outcomes.</p><p><strong>Circular Supply Chain</strong></p><p>The global supply chain focuses on creating a new economic infrastructure. The goal is replacing or integrating with legacy systems such as record-keeping, bills of lading, centrally managed systems of record, and distribution networks. Centralization has many challenges, the least of which is a lack of resilience in the global supply chain, as we have all seen and continue to experience in the COVID era.</p><p>Supply chains tend to start as decentralized. Markets and trade routes emerge from the bottom of the producer market and are aggregated into centralized supply chains, eventually working their way down to the consumer. We want to explore new patterns of commerce in bottom-up supply chains that could open and expand the local reputation network into markets that are currently inaccessible, such as:</p><ul><li>Regenerative agriculture</li><li>Locally produced art</li><li>Other forms of local commerce</li></ul><p>On the other side, distribution or demand-driven commerce has the potential to build a market force from the bottom-up that can engage the industrial global supply chain in ways that are not possible without establishing the voice and economic strength of the community digitally.</p><p>For the supply chain challenge, we want to address two significant challenges:</p><h5 id=small-producer-problem>Small Producer Problem</h5><p>How can we create transparency as the bottom-up process meets the industrialized supply chains, cuts through the centralized distribution markets, and connects directly to the consumer?</p><p>For example, small producers like a family ranch in Wyoming have no way to get information about the value of their product through these global aggregation and distribution networks. Currently, a solution such as the BeefChain project is supporting small ranchers.</p><p>There are multiple issues to overcome. For example, packaging plants are the entry point to the aggregation, so there is little or no incentive to deal with the small producer. We want to address this problem by building general-purpose tooling to assist communities in self-organizing and self-governing production according to agreed standards. We propose that if these communities can connect and grow, they will either:</p><ul><li>Reach the market through alternative distribution channels to industrial supply chains</li><li>Be able to negotiate as a community for better terms to have the values of their products recognized, distributed, and sold with value intact commercially and reputationally.</li></ul><h5 id=the-last-mile-problem>The Last-Mile Problem</h5><p>How can a local distributor in a local market interact with global industrial supply chains and be given access to the market that otherwise would be inaccessible due to a lack of economic identity or capital to access the goods at the scale required by industrial supply chains?</p><p>This challenge deals with distributing necessary products to local communities with little market clout or access to financial tools, such as credit, to interact with the industrial supply chain. We&rsquo;re looking for bottom-up tooling to establish a network of communities. Delegates in those communities can access the finance and credit necessary to interact with the industrial supply chain at the economic scale required for transactions.</p><p>An example of this problem is delivering health care supplies to rural and developing countries and economies. The funds from donors, the government, and other sources are available for these medical supplies. The donors will only release the funds once delivery is verified, and the medical supply companies will only send the goods to port once payment is received.</p><p>However, local small businesses must maintain transparency and oversight of the goods during delivery and receiving. These businesses do not have the funds or the ability to borrow capital to cover medical supplies costs from the delivery at the port to the hospitals and clinics that need them.</p><p>Addressing the challenge of the financial gap is vital. We believe that there is enormous potential to create bottom-up networks of trusted individuals and small businesses to fill this gap.</p><h5 id=a-proposed-pattern-language-outline-example>A Proposed Pattern Language Outline (example)</h5><p><strong>Primitives</strong></p><ul><li>Digital Identity</li><li>Verifiable Credential (VC)</li><li>Verifiable Presentation Request</li><li>Verifiable Presentation Proof</li><li>Cryptocurrency</li><li>Non-fungible token (NFT)</li><li>Smart contract</li></ul><p><strong>Patterns</strong></p><ul><li>Trust Registry</li><li>Governance Framework</li><li>Token Curated Registry</li><li>Community member recognition and onboarding process</li><li>Establishing Individual Reputation</li><li>Community as a whole group Interaction with an external party</li><li>Community member as an individual interaction with an external party</li><li>Community medium of exchange</li><li>Recognition of external Trust Registry</li><li>Recognition of external Governance Framework</li><li>Acceptance of Governance Framework by an external party</li></ul><p>With that as background, we are suggesting proposals in the following three areas:</p><ol><li>Interoperability between Cardano and Indy anchored DIDs/VCs.</li><li>Self-governance of Emergent Communities</li><li>Circular Supply Chain</li></ol></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-58d349d9624b52597bc1cc55120d21ae>3.3.2 - Business Solutions B2B & B2C</h1><div class=lead>How can Cardano-based solutions help meet real business needs and what would be their impact?</div><img src=https://cardano.ideascale.com/community-library/accounts/93/936143/Public/13-Business-Solutions-B2B--B2C-7b4b0f.png style=width:500px;height500px><p>Fund Size: <strong>1,000,000 USD paid in Ada</strong></p><p><a href=https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/382660>Campaign page</a> and <a href=https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26445/stage/all/ideas/unspecified>browse ideas</a>.</p><h2 id=campaign-brief>Campaign Brief</h2><p>How can Cardano-based solutions help meet real business needs and what would be their impact?</p><h3 id=why-is-it-important>Why is it important?</h3><p>Companies are finally discovering the power of blockchain technologies and Cardano is ready to onboard exciting B2B and B2C solutions.</p><h3 id=what-does-success-look-like>What does success look like?</h3><p>Innovative products and services that increase efficiency, transparency, and stakeholder engagement as well as expand business to new areas.</p><h3 id=key-metrics-to-measure>Key Metrics to measure</h3><ul><li>of Cardano dApps supporting business solutions</li><li>of existing companies proposing Cardano-based solutions</li><li>of partnerships,joint ventures created between companies</li><li>additional funding from other sources for the funded proposals</li><li>projected cost savings</li><li>projected revenue increase</li><li>growth in mainnet & testnet activity due to business solutions</li></ul><h2 id=challenge-brief>Challenge Brief</h2><p>For years blockchain has held a promise that has not been properly filled. Spot solutions for e.g. traceability, supply chain management, identification and payments have been implemented but large scale benefits of this promising technology are yet to be seen. Based on years of rigorous research and development, Cardano is one of the most serious contenders to fulfill this promise.</p><p>Recent and upcoming technological developments in Cardano—smart contracts, Yoroi dApp connector, larger block size (higher throughput), sidechains and state channels, to name a few—are gearing Cardano to be ready for large scale adoption in 2022.</p><p>Large corporations, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), platform businesses and highly networked startups have very different types of needs. Their industries may vary from finance and high-tech to agriculture and construction and from simple services to knowledge-intensive business. Yet, at the end of the day, they all need modern tools to keep fulfilling their mission, to remain relevant in global competition and to offer their employees the best tools to do what they were hired to do. Any company wants to engage their partners and employees, serve their customers better, improve their processes, cut costs, increase revenues and expand to new business areas.</p><p>By removing the middle man and automating processes, smart contract blockchain solutions can drive all of the above. Cardano can at least partly answer to these needs.</p><p><strong>In this challenge, proposed solutions can be tools, services, products, process improvements, data management solutions (CRM, ERP, MES, DMP etc), decentralized cloud solutions, privacy and security related offerings or even metaverse-related solutions.</strong></p><p>In your proposal, it would be good to outline the extent, limits and scope of the solution readiness-level of the solution, and whether it is e.g:</p><ul><li>A Feasibility Study, Proof-of-Concept, Minimum Viable Product that could be built on Cardano.</li><li>An existing business-ready product or service that could be converted to run on Cardano.</li><li>A business-oriented training or consultancy service.</li><li>An existing blockchain solution brought into the Cardano ecosystem to serve business needs.</li><li>A prototype or demo in operational environment</li><li>A creation of model of a system or subsystem</li><li>A process improvement</li></ul><p>When submitting proposals, please include the long-term vision, strategy and roadmap as well as short-term deliverables attainable in the next 6-9 months.

As the number of altcoins grew, unhealthy &ldquo;maximalism&rdquo; emerged. The future is multi-chain, however, and the cryptoeconomy thrives when interoperability and cross-chain collaboration are cherished and encouraged.</p><p>There are multiple next generation blockchains with cadres of zealous supporters, highly skilled developers and innovative technologies that Cardano and Project Catalyst can learn from. And, vice versa, we can help other networks thrive by offering the good practices developed in Catalyst. IOG has recently formed the UTXO alliance and started collaboration with numerous partners like COTI and SingularityNET. It&rsquo;s a good start but more is needed to address the lack of communication, coordination and collaboration between blockchain communities.

In this challenge, we provide funding for people who have learned about Cardano to take advantage of the community&rsquo;s support and build on or use the Cardano network.</p><p>The nature of the proposals for this challenge is open-ended. Their only requirement is to originate or focus on East Asia and include east Asian team members or focus on East Asian participants.</p><p>For instance, the overwhelming majority of Stake Pools reside in North America and Europe. The Cardano network will be more resilient when Stake Pools are evenly distributed across the globe. The Catalyst community needs to step up and intentionally make that happen.</p><p>Cardano started life in East Asia (Japan and Hong Kong), and Emurgo focuses on East Asia. Let&rsquo;s build upon that.</p><p>What this is:</p><p>A call to action; Activate the Cardano community&rsquo;s ability to recognise, reward the opportunity to make the world a better place. East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.</p><p>Addressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.</p><p>It is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. When the challenge succeeds, the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the benefits many of us were born with—allowing others with fewer privileged circumstances to rise and succeed.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-3813ad17e019339a2523561748da347d>3.3.12 - Grow India, Grow Cardano</h1><div class=lead>How can we grow Cardano development and adoption in India?</div><img src=https://cardano.ideascale.com/community-library/accounts/93/936143/Public/22-Grow-India-Grow-Cardano-82a925.png style=width:500px;height500px><p>Fund Size: <strong>150,000 USD paid in Ada</strong></p><p><a href=https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/381216>Campaign page</a> and <a href=https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26454/stage/all/ideas/unspecified>browse ideas</a>.</p><h2 id=campaign-brief>Campaign Brief</h2><p>How can we grow Cardano development and adoption in India?</p><h3 id=why-is-it-important>Why is it important?</h3><p>1.4B people. 55% under 30y (2016 est)</p><p>Local Cardano developers/businesses needed to solve local issues.</p><p>Significant poverty/unbanked</p><h3 id=what-does-success-look-like>What does success look like?</h3><p>Success is having multiple submissions for Catalyst Fund8 for India focused projects, with real-world projects getting funded and built.</p><h3 id=key-metrics-to-measure>Key Metrics to measure</h3><p>The overall key metrics would be:</p><ul><li>Increased interaction between Catalyst and Indian focused projects</li><li>Number of Indian focused Catalyst submissions</li><li>Number of Indian focused dapps/services actually built</li></ul><h2 id=challenge-brief>Challenge Brief</h2><p>As well as Africa, I think we should also put significant focus on Cardano within India.</p><p>India has a massive population of 1.4 billion.</p><p>55% are under the age of 30yrs (Wikipedia, 2016 est.)

So there is enough infrastructure and consumer devices in place to make this a serious market right away.</p><p>Having an India focused Catalyst challenge/fund would be very useful to gather teams and ideas and get the Cardano ball rolling in India. I am not Indian and have no connection to India, but I think that Cardano could be useful to help solve issues that they face and also to grow the Cardano eco-system.</p><p>On the surface issues in India might appear similar to Africa or South America, and there will be some overlap, but ideally local people identifying and solving local issues is best.</p><p>Emurgo has an office in India, but not sure what they are up to. IT in India is well established with a large pool of talent and skills available - we need to let them know about Cardano and the Catalyst funding. This proposal is intended to focus on India within a Fund8 challenge, with that challenge attracting actionable proposals to grow the community of developers and educators.</p><p>Some suggestions for that Fund8 challenge are:</p><ul><li><p>Setting up local Cardano hubs for regular catch ups (virtual or real world)</p></li><li><p>Local-language websites/socials/YT set up to attract developers/entrepreneurs to explain Cardano and Catalyst at a high-level</p></li><li><p>Fund a dapp and create a how-to video in local-language as a walk through to help educate and reduce perceived complexity</p></li><li><p>Run a competition/pitch-fest for dapp ideas with the top 10 ideas get funded to make a MVP</p></li><li><p>Connect with universities and training centers</p></li><li><p>Connect with new and established Indian YouTube channels to talk Cardano tech, dev ideas, business opportunities etc to create a buzz about Catalyst funding</p></li><li><p>Regularly promote awareness of Cardano and Catalyst funding to bring people into the space eg a 12 month campaign</p></li></ul><p>This is like a big heavy wheel that will take a lot of energy to get turning, but once it starts to move it will (hopefully) keep going with less energy needed.</p><p>How much ADA/USD should be available for this proposal?</p><p>I think it will take a few Catalyst rounds to build the Cardano interest in India, so the first round of investment during Fund8 should be $150k.

Additionally, projects that are better suited for the account-style method (instead of UTXO) also exist, and we want these projects to be usable from the Cardano ecosystem as well.</p><p>To accomplish this part of the roadmap, many efforts are currently underway such as KEVM, IELE, ERC20 Converter and Milkomeda to name a few. These projects are reaching the point where they are mature enough for people to deploy using them or build tooling for them and so it&rsquo;s time to start welcoming projects to Cardano.</p><p>You can hear Charles talk about the importance of this in his video &ldquo;The Island, The Ocean and the Pond&rdquo;</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/k8a6tX53YPs style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="bg-dark py-5 row d-print-none"><div class="container-fluid mx-sm-5"><div class=row><div class="col-6 col-sm-4 text-xs-center order-sm-2"><ul class="list-inline mb-0"><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Meetup aria-label=Meetup><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://www.meetup.com/Catalyst-Swarm-Sessions aria-label=Meetup><i class="fab fa-meetup"></i></a></li><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Discord aria-label=Discord><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://discord.gg/6T825EyvrG aria-label=Discord><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a></li><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Telegram aria-label=Telegram><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://t.me/joinchat/ODKTOvGnrHEwNTc6 aria-label=Telegram><i class="fab fa-telegram"></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="col-6 col-sm-4 text-right text-xs-center order-sm-3"><ul class="list-inline mb-0"><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=GitHub aria-label=GitHub><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://github.com/c3eth aria-label=GitHub><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a></li><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stack Overflow" aria-label="Stack Overflow"><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://cardano.stackexchange.com/ aria-label="Stack Overflow"><i class="fab fa-stack-overflow"></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="col-12 col-sm-4 text-center py-2 order-sm-2"><small class=text-white>&copy; 2022 Catalyst Community All Rights Reserved</small>
