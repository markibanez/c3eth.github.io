Many early stage ventures are now launching into the Cardano ecosystem and Catalyst wants to fuel many pioneering successes.</p><p>More needs to be done to accelerate best of breed Catalyst-funded projects by providing pathways into professional business support, investment, and mentoring programmes.</p><p>This is important to Catalyst because great ideas need to be nurtured and small teams need access to timely expertise and tools beyond those that they have in-house.</p><p>This challenge seeks professional-grade Accelerator programmes and Business Incubators to step up, co-develop, and deliver venture building programmes with Catalyst. The objective is to help catalyse early successes of Catalyst-funded projects and turn them into highly investable ventures. This helps projects funded by the community to get a fast track to resources and expertise that will help teams build invaluable know-how and strategy by plugging gaps in their current capabilities.</p><p>Key to this challenge is the alignment of the proposal to the challenge? And how will success be measured during the scope of the project and beyond?</p><p>Proposers should give strong consideration to providing evidence of their experience and history of success and also provide Catalyst voters and reviewers supporting information about the project&rsquo;s operational approach to delivering the objectives previously stated. The more detail the better.</p><p>We anticipate that a number of proposals that address this challenge will be funded in Fund 7 and we hope the community takes a portfolio approach to select projects from different parts of the world or a variety of themes relevant to the adoption of Cardano-based projects and the Cardano ecosystem as a whole.</p><h2 id=why-is-it-important>why is it Important?</h2><p>Knowledge is power and enabling project&rsquo;s to tap into to a distributed network of professional mentors and supporters will enable ventures to grow stronger and faster.

As a result, different online merchants, from a small hotel in Europe to a big e-commerce website in Asia, can easily accept hundreds or thousands of ADA transactions when integrating ADA Pay into their site.</p><p>With Catalyst, we are offering an innovative technical challenge to our communities to allow a new and creative way for all small and medium enterprises currently using platforms, such as Shopify and WooCommerce, to readily accept ADA Payments with seamless integration by adding a plug-in into their site.</p><p>In a nutshell, ADA Pay currently provides the ability to send a separate payment request to each payment attempt, allowing merchants to effectively identify each client without requiring the customer&rsquo;s identity before completing the order. In other words, companies integrating ADA Pay enjoy the ability to send a unique address to a potential customer and be notified at every stage of the payment process via Webhook. Moreover, by registering the payment request on the client&rsquo;s backend, merchants can know who pays for what without disclosing the client&rsquo;s information to a third party.</p><p>The teams proceeding with the challenge will be provided with an API Key to the ADA Pay system and complete API documentation of the payment solution. The API Key will allow you to receive and send payments with ADA over the Cardano testnet. The API documentation also includes endpoints to create payment requests, withdraw your funds, and a webhook to notify you of any ongoing activity regarding the payment request.</p><p>With the tools described above, we expect from the teams involved in the challenge to create an innovative plug-in that will be integrated with our current ADA Pay system on the one hand and support all the different e-commerce software mentioned above (Shopify and WooCommerce) on the other.</p><h2 id=how-does-success-look-like>How does success look like?</h2><p>At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves: Do we have a simple, flawless, and easy-to-integrate ADA Pay plug-in solution ready to be integrated into different e-commerce platforms?</p><p>Is the UI and payment flow of the plug-in user-friendly? For example, is the process smooth from when customers add items into their cart until the transaction is complete?</p><p>Be creative; the fewer clicks needed to complete a transaction, the better.</p><h2 id=key-metrics-to-measure>Key Metrics to measure</h2><ul><li>Total amount of e-commerce platforms that can be integrated into the new component.</li><li>Ratio of total transaction attempts and transactions completed, measuring the effectiveness of the payment flow proposed.</li><li>Scalability of the plug-in without compromising the quality of the service.</li><li>Number of merchants that can be integrated with the plug-in.</li></ul><h2 id=guiding-questions>Guiding Questions:</h2><p>We would like you to consider the following and provide rationales about the planned approach in your proposals.</p><ul><li>How will you test the plug-in&rsquo;s quality, and how easy is it to implement it into the software platforms?</li><li>Is the plug-in able to process big amounts of transactions per second from different websites without problems?</li><li>How do you intend to design for the user&rsquo;s needs and incorporate Merchant&rsquo;s feedback regarding the plug-in performance?</li></ul><h2 id=funding-parameters>Funding Parameters</h2><p>COTI are providing the funding for all challenge rewards.</p><p>Proposers: Successful proposers will be funded in COTI token.

Between now and then, any member of the Catalyst Community inspired to write a proposal will get access to the Atala PRISM Pioneer Program first cohort course materials on Canvas. Please submit your proposal on Ideascale, including your email address, to get an invitation to Canvas.</p><p>With this access, you&rsquo;ll join the growing Atala PRISM community. Our Atala PRISM product team and engineers will be available via a dedicated Discord channel. Inclusion in our Professional Services Group governance framework foundry. Access to fireside chats with the top leaders in the SSI space, where we&rsquo;ll discuss trends, use cases, and much more. In addition, we will support the growth of high-value credentials and enable partners from concept, to development, to commercialization.</p><h3 id=areas-of-focus><strong>Areas of focus</strong></h3><h5 id=interoperability><strong>Interoperability</strong></h5><p>Most digital credentials sit on Hyperledger Indy ledgers, including those issued by governments in Germany, Canada, and the UK.</p><p>The best-performing platform will gain the largest market share. For many reasons, we believe our platform is superior. Therefore, Cardano and Atala PRISM must include a plan to interact with these other ecosystems to maximize market share.</p><p>We encourage Catalyst proposals to achieve full interoperability. Deliverables should optimize the user experience (UX) for Atala PRISM credentials while remaining compatible with other platforms.</p><h5 id=self-governance-of-emergent-communities><strong>Self-governance of Emergent Communities</strong></h5><h5 id=dao-governance-in-practice>DAO Governance in Practice</h5><p>New legislation in Wyoming allows for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to be registered with the state. We challenge the community to establish a DAO under the new laws. It could manage an impact or development goal with shared common resources governed by the DAO.</p><p>We are curious to see if our community proposes a DAO. With a funded proposal, we could facilitate introductions to legal experts in Wyoming.</p><p>The proposal should consider setting aside funds for legal expenses to establish the DAO and legal documentation.</p><h5 id=patterns-of-commoning>Patterns of Commoning</h5><p>We draw inspiration from the work of the <a href=https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/YOMA+Ecosystem+Task+Force>Trust Over IP Foundation</a> and the principles from &lsquo;Patterns of Commoning.&rsquo; We see the potential for innovation by linking communities with shared interests under these principles.</p><p>How can these principles become plug-and-play code as technological primitives that other communities can leverage and unlock exponential growth and adoption?</p><p>We are interested in exploring a rich playground of ideas and bringing these to real-world implementations on Cardano and Atala PRISM.</p><h5 id=education-career-and-emergent-reputation-primitives>Education, Career, and Emergent Reputation Primitives</h5><p>Many of our Pioneer and Catalyst-funded projects support education and career programs. One of the defining characteristics of these approaches is the creation of alternatives to accredited education and career paths.</p><p>We need our community to think about developing technology and governance primitives to support any community that wants to establish new education and career paths by providing tools:</p><ul><li>For onboarding new experts and teachers</li><li>For people in the community to develop and grow</li><li>For maintaining a reputation as a skilled employee, laborer, consultant, mentor, teacher, etc.</li></ul><p>When reputation standards change, we need ways to self-heal and self-monitor for bad actors, harmful actions, or bad outcomes.</p><h5 id=circular-supply-chain><strong>Circular Supply Chain</strong></h5><p>The global supply chain focuses on creating a new economic infrastructure. The goal is replacing or integrating with legacy systems such as record-keeping, bills of lading, centrally managed systems of record, and distribution networks. Centralization has many challenges, the least of which is a lack of resilience in the global supply chain, as we have all seen and continue to experience in the COVID era.</p><p>Supply chains tend to start as decentralized. Markets and trade routes emerge from the bottom of the producer market and are aggregated into centralized supply chains, eventually working their way down to the consumer. We want to explore new patterns of commerce in bottom-up supply chains that could open and expand the local reputation network into markets that are currently inaccessible, such as:</p><ul><li>Regenerative agriculture</li><li>Locally produced art</li><li>Other forms of local commerce</li></ul><p>On the other side, distribution or demand-driven commerce has the potential to build a market force from the bottom-up that can engage the industrial global supply chain in ways that are not possible without establishing the voice and economic strength of the community digitally.</p><p>For the supply chain challenge, we want to address two significant challenges:</p><h5 id=small-producer-problem>Small Producer Problem</h5><p>How can we create transparency as the bottom-up process meets the industrialized supply chains, cuts through the centralized distribution markets, and connects directly to the consumer?</p><p>For example, small producers like a family ranch in Wyoming have no way to get information about the value of their product through these global aggregation and distribution networks. Currently, a solution such as the <a href=https://beefchain.com/>BeefChain project</a> is supporting small ranchers.</p><p>There are multiple issues to overcome. For example, packaging plants are the entry point to the aggregation, so there is little or no incentive to deal with the small producer. We want to address this problem by building general-purpose tooling to assist communities in self-organizing and self-governing production according to agreed standards. We propose that if these communities can connect and grow, they will either:</p><p>Reach the market through alternative distribution channels to industrial supply chains
Be able to negotiate as a community for better terms to have the values of their products recognized, distributed, and sold with value intact commercially and reputationally.</p><h5 id=the-last-mile-problem>The Last-Mile Problem</h5><p>How can a local distributor in a local market interact with global industrial supply chains and be given access to the market that otherwise would be inaccessible due to a lack of economic identity or capital to access the goods at the scale required by industrial supply chains?</p><p>This challenge deals with distributing necessary products to local communities with little market clout or access to financial tools, such as credit, to interact with the industrial supply chain. We&rsquo;re looking for bottom-up tooling to establish a network of communities. Delegates in those communities can access the finance and credit necessary to interact with the industrial supply chain at the economic scale required for transactions.</p><p>An example of this problem is delivering health care supplies to rural and developing countries and economies. The funds from donors, the government, and other sources are available for these medical supplies. The donors will only release the funds once delivery is verified, and the medical supply companies will only send the goods to port once payment is received.</p><p>However, local small businesses must maintain transparency and oversight of the goods during delivery and receiving. These businesses do not have the funds or the ability to borrow capital to cover medical supplies costs from the delivery at the port to the hospitals and clinics that need them.</p><p>Addressing the challenge of the financial gap is vital. We believe that there is enormous potential to create bottom-up networks of trusted individuals and small businesses to fill this gap.</p><h2 id=why-is-it-important>Why is it Important?</h2><p>How individuals interact with their communities and the broader economy helps us understand which credentials improve their daily lives. By identifying these high-value, high-impact credentials, we can establish governance framework foundries for launching pilot programs and driving growth. Ultimately, this will cause further adoption of Cardano and Atala PRISM technology.</p><h2 id=how-does-success-look-like>How does success look like?</h2><p>Discover repeatable patterns that unlock our ability to leverage the Cardano decentralized infrastructure. Identify high-value credentials and use cases. Once identified, we can form stakeholder governance framework working groups. These groups will allow us to foster the development of community, partner, and vendor ecosystems to launch into commercial and production environments.</p><h2 id=key-metrics-to-measure>Key Metrics to measure</h2><ul><li>The sum of realized production pilots or launches in 2022</li><li>Discovery of repeatable patterns in use-cases</li><li>The number of issuers, holders, and verifiers</li><li>The number of verifications performed on credentials in production</li></ul><h4 id=a-proposed-pattern-language-outline-example><strong>A Proposed Pattern Language Outline (example)</strong></h4><h5 id=primitives><strong>Primitives</strong></h5><ul><li>Digital Identity</li><li>Verifiable Credential (VC)</li><li>Verifiable Presentation Request</li><li>Verifiable Presentation Proof</li><li>Cryptocurrency</li><li>Non-fungible token (NFT)</li><li>Smart Contract</li></ul><h5 id=patterns><strong>Patterns</strong></h5><ul><li>Trust Registry</li><li>Governance Framework</li><li>Token Curated Registry</li><li>Community member recognition and onboarding process</li><li>Establishing Individual Reputation</li><li>Community as a whole group Interaction with an external party</li><li>Community member as an individual interaction with an external party</li><li>Community medium of exchange</li><li>Recognition of external Trust Registry</li><li>Recognition of external Governance Framework</li><li>Acceptance of Governance Framework by an external party</li></ul><p>With that as background, we are suggesting proposals in the following three areas:</p><ol><li>Interoperability between Cardano and Indy anchored DIDs/VCs.</li><li>Self-governance of Emergent Communities</li><li>Circular Supply Chain</li></ol></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-20bac6c015cd3857dd15329897679d02>5 - Boosting Cardano's DeFi</h1><div class=lead>How can we encourage DeFi teams to build/deploy open finance solutions on Cardano in the next 6 months?</div><p>Fund Size: <strong>$500,000 USD paid in Ada</strong></p><p><a href=https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26233>Campaign page</a> and <a href=https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/ideas/top/campaign-filter/byids/campaigns/26233/stage/unspecified>browse ideas</a>and <a href=https://github.com/Catalyst-Challenges/F7-Boosting-Cardanos-DeFi>Git Repository</a> and <a href=https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/catalyst-fund-7-challenges/fund-7/boosting-cardanos-defi>Git Book</a></p><h2 id=campaign-brief>Campaign Brief</h2><p>The previous challenge(ScaleUP Cardano&rsquo;s DeFi Ecosystem) demonstrated success and allowed popular DeFi projects such as Liqwid Finance, Minswap and ErgoDEX to be funded by the treasury, without the participation of venture capitals and with fair launch models, allowing sustainable distribution of the supply among the community/userbase.</p><p>The fact that ERGODEX&rsquo;s proposal was the second best voted proposal in the Left-Over budget is an important indicator to demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposals presented in Fund5.</p><p>Currently, the vast majority of DeFi dapps and assets flows occur on the Ethereum blockchain, however due to congestion and increased transaction fees, the use of DeFi is increasingly elitized, leaving out the people who could most benefit from it, the unbanked.</p><p>Over the past year several DeFi projects have been moving to more scalable blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, Solana, among others. Second layer solutions are also being used as alternatives to Ethereum main chain, Polygon has been a great example.</p><p>In this migration and bridges creation scenario, some projects are turning to Cardano to create their DeFi projects.</p><p>Cardano is finally delivering smart contracts and that opens a door to a lot of innovation in DeFi. We can offer not only a scalable blockchain, but also a secure blockchain and aggregated governance layer in the near future. This set of characteristics place Cardano in a prominent place and with a good opportunity to gain market share and expand the user base.</p><p>With Catalyst, we have the opportunity to fund DeFi projects and allow them to have greater decentralization and resilience, which are essential aspects for DeFi projects. Many projects end up accepting the participation of Venture Capitals due to lack of financial resources. The participation of VCs in DeFi projects usually ends up causing a large part of the supply distribution to be alocated to VCs and this compromises the decentralization and consequently the security of these projects.</p><p>The DeFi ecosystem today is taken over by projects full of vulnerabilities, hacks are constant, economic models are copied from other projects, decentralization is no longer a priority and few projects are dedicated to create economic models/bonding curves/algorithms thinking about the users&rsquo; needs.</p><p>It has become clear over the year that bugs, hacks and vulnerabilities are not unique to smart contracts on Ethereum.

By supporting and promoting smaller mission focussed SPO&rsquo;s the security of the whole network benefits.

Second layer solutions are also being used as alternatives to Ethereum main chain, Polygon has been a great example.</p><p>In this migration and bridges creation scenario, some projects are turning to Cardano to create their DeFi projects.</p><p>Cardano is finally delivering smart contracts and that opens a door to a lot of innovation in DeFi. We can offer not only a scalable blockchain, but also a secure blockchain and aggregated governance layer in the near future. This set of characteristics place Cardano in a prominent place and with a good opportunity to gain market share and expand the user base.</p><p>With Catalyst, we have the opportunity to fund DeFi projects and allow them to have greater decentralization and resilience, which are essential aspects for DeFi projects. Many projects end up accepting the participation of Venture Capitals due to lack of financial resources. The participation of VCs in DeFi projects usually ends up causing a large part of the supply distribution to be alocated to VCs and this compromises the decentralization and consequently the security of these projects.</p><p>The DeFi ecosystem today is taken over by projects full of vulnerabilities, hacks are constant, economic models are copied from other projects, decentralization is no longer a priority and few projects are dedicated to create economic models/bonding curves/algorithms thinking about the users&rsquo; needs.</p><p>It has become clear over the year that bugs, hacks and vulnerabilities are not unique to smart contracts on Ethereum. Dapps running on Binance Smart Chain and Cosmos suffered from vulnerabilities as well.</p><ul><li><p><a href=https://cointelegraph.com/news/hackers-stole-at-least-600m-in-poly-exploit-across-three-chains>Hackers stole at least $600M in Poly exploit across three chains</a></p></li><li><p><a href=https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/111660/thorchain-suffers-5-million-exploit-developers-have-put-out-a-fix>Thorchain suffers $5 million exploit, developers have put out a fix</a></p></li></ul><p>Cardano arrives to change this paradigm and bring security to users.</p><p>Privacy and resistance to censorship are also important but often overlooked in favor of subsidizing (yield farming).
