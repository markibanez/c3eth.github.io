Between now and then, any member of the Catalyst Community inspired to write a proposal will get access to the Atala PRISM Pioneer Program first cohort course materials on Canvas. Please submit your proposal on Ideascale, including your email address, to get an invitation to Canvas.</p><p>With this access, you&rsquo;ll join the growing Atala PRISM community. Our Atala PRISM product team and engineers will be available via a dedicated Discord channel. Inclusion in our Professional Services Group governance framework foundry. Access to fireside chats with the top leaders in the SSI space, where we&rsquo;ll discuss trends, use cases, and much more. In addition, we will support the growth of high-value credentials and enable partners from concept, to development, to commercialization.</p><h2 id=areas-of-focus>Areas of Focus</h2><h3 id=interoperability>Interoperability</h3><p>Most digital credentials sit on Hyperledger Indy ledgers, including those issued by governments in Germany, Canada, and the UK.</p><p>The best-performing platform will gain the largest market share. For many reasons, we believe our platform is superior. Therefore, Cardano and Atala PRISM must include a plan to interact with these other ecosystems to maximize market share.</p><p>We encourage Catalyst proposals to achieve full interoperability. Deliverables should optimize the user experience (UX) for Atala PRISM credentials while remaining compatible with other platforms.</p><h3 id=self-governance-of-emergent-communities>Self-governance of Emergent Communities</h3><h5 id=dao-governance-in-practice>DAO Governance in Practice</h5><p>New legislation in Wyoming allows for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to be registered with the state. We challenge the community to establish a DAO under the new laws. It could manage an impact or development goal with shared common resources governed by the DAO.</p><p>We are curious to see if our community proposes a DAO. With a funded proposal, we could facilitate introductions to legal experts in Wyoming.</p><p>The proposal should consider setting aside funds for legal expenses to establish the DAO and legal documentation.</p><h5 id=patterns-of-commoning>Patterns of Commoning</h5><p>We draw inspiration from the work of the Trust Over IP Foundation and the principles from &lsquo;Patterns of Commoning.&rsquo; We see the potential for innovation by linking communities with shared interests under these principles.</p><p>How can these principles become plug-and-play code as technological primitives that other communities can leverage and unlock exponential growth and adoption?</p><p>We are interested in exploring a rich playground of ideas and bringing these to real-world implementations on Cardano and Atala PRISM.</p><h5 id=education-career-and-emergent-reputation-primitives>Education, Career, and Emergent Reputation Primitives</h5><p>Many of our Pioneer and Catalyst-funded projects support education and career programs. One of the defining characteristics of these approaches is the creation of alternatives to accredited education and career paths.</p><p>We need our community to think about developing technology and governance primitives to support any community that wants to establish new education and career paths by providing tools:</p><ul><li>For onboarding new experts and teachers</li><li>For people in the community to develop and grow</li><li>For maintaining a reputation as a skilled employee, laborer, consultant, mentor, teacher, etc.</li></ul><p>When reputation standards change, we need ways to self-heal and self-monitor for bad actors, harmful actions, or bad outcomes.</p><p><strong>Circular Supply Chain</strong></p><p>The global supply chain focuses on creating a new economic infrastructure. The goal is replacing or integrating with legacy systems such as record-keeping, bills of lading, centrally managed systems of record, and distribution networks. Centralization has many challenges, the least of which is a lack of resilience in the global supply chain, as we have all seen and continue to experience in the COVID era.</p><p>Supply chains tend to start as decentralized. Markets and trade routes emerge from the bottom of the producer market and are aggregated into centralized supply chains, eventually working their way down to the consumer. We want to explore new patterns of commerce in bottom-up supply chains that could open and expand the local reputation network into markets that are currently inaccessible, such as:</p><ul><li>Regenerative agriculture</li><li>Locally produced art</li><li>Other forms of local commerce</li></ul><p>On the other side, distribution or demand-driven commerce has the potential to build a market force from the bottom-up that can engage the industrial global supply chain in ways that are not possible without establishing the voice and economic strength of the community digitally.</p><p>For the supply chain challenge, we want to address two significant challenges:</p><h5 id=small-producer-problem>Small Producer Problem</h5><p>How can we create transparency as the bottom-up process meets the industrialized supply chains, cuts through the centralized distribution markets, and connects directly to the consumer?</p><p>For example, small producers like a family ranch in Wyoming have no way to get information about the value of their product through these global aggregation and distribution networks. Currently, a solution such as the BeefChain project is supporting small ranchers.</p><p>There are multiple issues to overcome. For example, packaging plants are the entry point to the aggregation, so there is little or no incentive to deal with the small producer. We want to address this problem by building general-purpose tooling to assist communities in self-organizing and self-governing production according to agreed standards. We propose that if these communities can connect and grow, they will either:</p><ul><li>Reach the market through alternative distribution channels to industrial supply chains</li><li>Be able to negotiate as a community for better terms to have the values of their products recognized, distributed, and sold with value intact commercially and reputationally.</li></ul><h5 id=the-last-mile-problem>The Last-Mile Problem</h5><p>How can a local distributor in a local market interact with global industrial supply chains and be given access to the market that otherwise would be inaccessible due to a lack of economic identity or capital to access the goods at the scale required by industrial supply chains?</p><p>This challenge deals with distributing necessary products to local communities with little market clout or access to financial tools, such as credit, to interact with the industrial supply chain. We&rsquo;re looking for bottom-up tooling to establish a network of communities. Delegates in those communities can access the finance and credit necessary to interact with the industrial supply chain at the economic scale required for transactions.</p><p>An example of this problem is delivering health care supplies to rural and developing countries and economies. The funds from donors, the government, and other sources are available for these medical supplies. The donors will only release the funds once delivery is verified, and the medical supply companies will only send the goods to port once payment is received.</p><p>However, local small businesses must maintain transparency and oversight of the goods during delivery and receiving. These businesses do not have the funds or the ability to borrow capital to cover medical supplies costs from the delivery at the port to the hospitals and clinics that need them.</p><p>Addressing the challenge of the financial gap is vital. We believe that there is enormous potential to create bottom-up networks of trusted individuals and small businesses to fill this gap.</p><h5 id=a-proposed-pattern-language-outline-example>A Proposed Pattern Language Outline (example)</h5><p><strong>Primitives</strong></p><ul><li>Digital Identity</li><li>Verifiable Credential (VC)</li><li>Verifiable Presentation Request</li><li>Verifiable Presentation Proof</li><li>Cryptocurrency</li><li>Non-fungible token (NFT)</li><li>Smart contract</li></ul><p><strong>Patterns</strong></p><ul><li>Trust Registry</li><li>Governance Framework</li><li>Token Curated Registry</li><li>Community member recognition and onboarding process</li><li>Establishing Individual Reputation</li><li>Community as a whole group Interaction with an external party</li><li>Community member as an individual interaction with an external party</li><li>Community medium of exchange</li><li>Recognition of external Trust Registry</li><li>Recognition of external Governance Framework</li><li>Acceptance of Governance Framework by an external party</li></ul><p>With that as background, we are suggesting proposals in the following three areas:</p><ol><li>Interoperability between Cardano and Indy anchored DIDs/VCs.</li><li>Self-governance of Emergent Communities</li><li>Circular Supply Chain</li></ol></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-58d349d9624b52597bc1cc55120d21ae>3.2 - Business Solutions B2B & B2C</h1><div class=lead>How can Cardano-based solutions help meet real business needs and what would be their impact?</div><img src=https://cardano.ideascale.com/community-library/accounts/93/936143/Public/13-Business-Solutions-B2B--B2C-7b4b0f.png style=width:500px;height500px><p>Fund Size: <strong>1,000,000 USD paid in Ada</strong></p><p><a href=https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/382660>Campaign page</a> and <a href=https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26445/stage/all/ideas/unspecified>browse ideas</a>.</p><h2 id=campaign-brief>Campaign Brief</h2><p>How can Cardano-based solutions help meet real business needs and what would be their impact?</p><h3 id=why-is-it-important>Why is it important?</h3><p>Companies are finally discovering the power of blockchain technologies and Cardano is ready to onboard exciting B2B and B2C solutions.</p><h3 id=what-does-success-look-like>What does success look like?</h3><p>Innovative products and services that increase efficiency, transparency, and stakeholder engagement as well as expand business to new areas.</p><h3 id=key-metrics-to-measure>Key Metrics to measure</h3><ul><li>of Cardano dApps supporting business solutions</li><li>of existing companies proposing Cardano-based solutions</li><li>of partnerships,joint ventures created between companies</li><li>additional funding from other sources for the funded proposals</li><li>projected cost savings</li><li>projected revenue increase</li><li>growth in mainnet & testnet activity due to business solutions</li></ul><h2 id=challenge-brief>Challenge Brief</h2><p>For years blockchain has held a promise that has not been properly filled. Spot solutions for e.g. traceability, supply chain management, identification and payments have been implemented but large scale benefits of this promising technology are yet to be seen. Based on years of rigorous research and development, Cardano is one of the most serious contenders to fulfill this promise.</p><p>Recent and upcoming technological developments in Cardano—smart contracts, Yoroi dApp connector, larger block size (higher throughput), sidechains and state channels, to name a few—are gearing Cardano to be ready for large scale adoption in 2022.</p><p>Large corporations, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), platform businesses and highly networked startups have very different types of needs. Their industries may vary from finance and high-tech to agriculture and construction and from simple services to knowledge-intensive business. Yet, at the end of the day, they all need modern tools to keep fulfilling their mission, to remain relevant in global competition and to offer their employees the best tools to do what they were hired to do. Any company wants to engage their partners and employees, serve their customers better, improve their processes, cut costs, increase revenues and expand to new business areas.</p><p>By removing the middle man and automating processes, smart contract blockchain solutions can drive all of the above. Cardano can at least partly answer to these needs.</p><p><strong>In this challenge, proposed solutions can be tools, services, products, process improvements, data management solutions (CRM, ERP, MES, DMP etc), decentralized cloud solutions, privacy and security related offerings or even metaverse-related solutions.</strong></p><p>In your proposal, it would be good to outline the extent, limits and scope of the solution readiness-level of the solution, and whether it is e.g:</p><ul><li>A Feasibility Study, Proof-of-Concept, Minimum Viable Product that could be built on Cardano.</li><li>An existing business-ready product or service that could be converted to run on Cardano.</li><li>A business-oriented training or consultancy service.</li><li>An existing blockchain solution brought into the Cardano ecosystem to serve business needs.</li><li>A prototype or demo in operational environment</li><li>A creation of model of a system or subsystem</li><li>A process improvement</li></ul><p>When submitting proposals, please include the long-term vision, strategy and roadmap as well as short-term deliverables attainable in the next 6-9 months. Visualization and video materials are more than welcome to explain often complex business solutions.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-4d1a75b6b272626fc683788a8aaacea2>3.3 - Cardano Scaling Solutions</h1><div class=lead>What research and scaling implementations can be introduced to help Cardano increase scalability?</div><img src=https://cardano.ideascale.com/community-library/accounts/93/936143/Public/05-Cardano-scaling-solutions-7a0e11.png style=width:500px;height500px><p>Fund Size: <strong>400,000 USD paid in Ada</strong></p><p><a href=https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/383094>Campaign page</a> and <a href=https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26437/stage/all/ideas/unspecified>browse ideas</a>.</p><h2 id=campaign-brief>Campaign Brief</h2><p>What research and scaling implementations can be introduced to help Cardano increase scalability?</p><h3 id=why-is-it-important>Why is it important?</h3><p>Hydra will not solve every scaling problem in Cardano, more scaling solutions are needed as alternatives.</p><h3 id=what-does-success-look-like>What does success look like?</h3><p>Scaling solutions that are introduced and implemented by the community that Cardano projects can start using.</p><h3 id=key-metrics-to-measure>Key Metrics to measure</h3><ul><li>Number of scaling solutions available to the community to use within their projects</li><li>Number of projects launched on any of the new scaling solutions</li><li>Novel ideas generated from research on different scaling approaches</li></ul><h2 id=challenge-brief>Challenge Brief</h2><p>For Cardano to become a global leader as a smart contract blockchain it will need to scale to meet the requirements of handling hundreds of millions of users.</p><h3 id=current-scaling-situation>Current Scaling Situation</h3><p>Hydra is the leading project being executed by IOG to help Cardano scale the blockchain.</p><p>The first phase of Hydra will be available in 2022 however this initial implementation will not resolve all of the problems needed for Cardano to scale.</p><p>Sebastien from dcSpark recently discussed the importance of rollups and alternative solutions in an interview -</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4DslvkLop04 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h3 id=need-for-more-scaling-options>Need for more scaling options</h3><p>To reach true decentralization the Cardano community will need to not rely on the input from IOG as much as it does now as we move into the future.</p><p>Hydra will only have it&rsquo;s initial implementation released early next year.

As the number of altcoins grew, unhealthy &ldquo;maximalism&rdquo; emerged. The future is multi-chain, however, and the cryptoeconomy thrives when interoperability and cross-chain collaboration are cherished and encouraged.</p><p>There are multiple next generation blockchains with cadres of zealous supporters, highly skilled developers and innovative technologies that Cardano and Project Catalyst can learn from. And, vice versa, we can help other networks thrive by offering the good practices developed in Catalyst. IOG has recently formed the UTXO alliance and started collaboration with numerous partners like COTI and SingularityNET. It&rsquo;s a good start but more is needed to address the lack of communication, coordination and collaboration between blockchain communities.

East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.</p><p>Addressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.</p><p>It is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement.

I am not Indian and have no connection to India, but I think that Cardano could be useful to help solve issues that they face and also to grow the Cardano eco-system.</p><p>On the surface issues in India might appear similar to Africa or South America, and there will be some overlap, but ideally local people identifying and solving local issues is best.</p><p>Emurgo has an office in India, but not sure what they are up to. IT in India is well established with a large pool of talent and skills available - we need to let them know about Cardano and the Catalyst funding. This proposal is intended to focus on India within a Fund8 challenge, with that challenge attracting actionable proposals to grow the community of developers and educators.</p><p>Some suggestions for that Fund8 challenge are:</p><ul><li><p>Setting up local Cardano hubs for regular catch ups (virtual or real world)</p></li><li><p>Local-language websites/socials/YT set up to attract developers/entrepreneurs to explain Cardano and Catalyst at a high-level</p></li><li><p>Fund a dapp and create a how-to video in local-language as a walk through to help educate and reduce perceived complexity</p></li><li><p>Run a competition/pitch-fest for dapp ideas with the top 10 ideas get funded to make a MVP</p></li><li><p>Connect with universities and training centers</p></li><li><p>Connect with new and established Indian YouTube channels to talk Cardano tech, dev ideas, business opportunities etc to create a buzz about Catalyst funding</p></li><li><p>Regularly promote awareness of Cardano and Catalyst funding to bring people into the space eg a 12 month campaign</p></li></ul><p>This is like a big heavy wheel that will take a lot of energy to get turning, but once it starts to move it will (hopefully) keep going with less energy needed.</p><p>How much ADA/USD should be available for this proposal?</p><p>I think it will take a few Catalyst rounds to build the Cardano interest in India, so the first round of investment during Fund8 should be $150k. Subsequent funding rounds can be determined at the time and then voted on by the community.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-cadae11f4c2fa6e4dde60ca17f1b3e42>3.13 - Improve and Grow Auditability</h1><div class=lead>How to make the auditing process of funded proposals efficient, distributed and transparent?</div><img src=https://cardano.ideascale.com/community-library/accounts/93/936143/Public/15-Improve-and-Grow-Auditability-5955cb.png style=width:500px;height500px><p>Fund Size: <strong>200,000 USD paid in Ada</strong></p><p><a href=https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/383480>Campaign page</a> and <a href=https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26447/stage/all/ideas/unspecified>browse ideas</a>.</p><h2 id=campaign-brief>Campaign Brief</h2><p>How to make the auditing process of funded proposals efficient, distributed and transparent?</p><h3 id=why-is-it-important>Why is it important?</h3><p>It&rsquo;s important that the funded proposals are evaluated to see if they are delivering what was established in their mission..</p><h3 id=what-does-success-look-like>What does success look like?</h3><p>Several projects evaluating funded proposals, providing reports, articles and metrics on the development and implementation of the projects.</p><h3 id=key-metrics-to-measure>Key Metrics to measure</h3><ul><li>Number of funded proposals audited</li><li>Considering that the idea is to audit and report on the development of proposals in different challenges, it is important that - - - success metrics are thought out in relation to each challenge.</li><li>Number of reports, articles and videos/podcasts on:</li><li>Performance</li><li>Achievements</li><li>Financials</li><li>Number of onboarded developers.</li><li>Number of commits in funded proposal repositories (Github)</li><li>Indicators of: transactions, volume and unique wallets interacting with dapps.</li><li>Number of smart contracts audited.</li><li>Social media engagement indicators.</li></ul><h2 id=challenge-brief>Challenge Brief</h2><p>When Fund7 happens we will be close to 300 funded proposals.

When we approach hubs from the lens of information-delivery nodes, we can build a hub taxonomy within a need-impact matrix and then find the most capital efficient model for each location.</li></ol><p>In simpler terms, consider why a hub exists, in the context of it&rsquo;s location, access to infrastructure and community readiness. Then design a hub according to those factors, with a traditional brick-and-mortar (CTH) being only one out of many potential information-delivery systems within a local community.</p><p><strong>This round will focus much more on &lsquo;minimum-viable hubs&rsquo; (MVHs)</strong>, what is the smallest effective unit for a hub, and by identifying this unit, can we begin to scale CCHs more rapidly.</p><p><em><strong>Additional Success Metrics:</strong></em></p><ul><li>Is the hub&rsquo;s Fund 8 proposal in keeping with the MVH principle?</li><li>Do they have an understanding of their target audience?</li><li>Can they accurately project their reach (physical and online) in the first 3, 6, 12 months?</li><li>Can they accurately project the number of onboarded members to the hub in 3, 6, 12 months?</li><li>Have they given an indication of a financial sustainability model?</li><li>Have they given an indication of budget costs vs &lsquo;cost to launch&rsquo;?
