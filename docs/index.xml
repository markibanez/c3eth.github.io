&lt;p>Project Catalyst is underway and we’re seeing some incredible participation from a wide
spectrum of individuals. This is a collaborative process to create a worldwide community
innovation project. The problem statement, solution, relevant experience, and funds requested
will be displayed in the voting application. This will allow everyone to learn about the initiatives
before voting on them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The proposal plans and attachments can be viewed on our innovation platform, hosted by
Ideascale, in order to gain an understanding of the details. This all means that we want everyone
to feel confident in contributing to the discussion as a whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The quality of the output is dependent on the community’s ability to create and engage with new
ideas. To that end, we would like to share a quick guide to writing successful proposals:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="proposing-a-title-35-char-limit-">Proposing a title* (35 char limit) +&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The proposal name should give an indication of the innovation that you are trying to achieve
while also grabbing people’s attention. But we want to avoid any slick marketing speak. Just tell
your audience what it does and who it is for as clearly as possible. Keep it simple and
informative and keep your audience in mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Example Title:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Stake pool operator vlog network&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="how-to-write-a-problem-statement-140-char-limit">How To Write a Problem Statement (140 Char limit)&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="rising-to-the-challenge">Rising to the challenge&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Each fund will have a specific challenge which proposals will attempt to solve. Challenges will
originally be set by the Project Catalyst team and then opportunities will arise for the community
to develop their own. It is crucial that proposals address the challenge directly. Here is an
example of a challenge and some problem statements which address it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="challenge">Challenge&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses
on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem statements&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Builders don’t want to deal with the red tape\time cost of securing funding.
How do we help Cardano builders streamline proposals?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I am trying to solve the problem of bootstrapping decentralized\open
finance movement on Cardano before Plutus and Marlowe hit mainnet.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In both of these examples the relationship between the problem statements and the challenge
is apparent. This is what voters will be looking for. However, while the content of the problem
statements is clear and effective, these problem statements can be improved.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="making-great-problem-statements-140-char-limit">Making great problem statements (140 char. limit)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The problem statement identifies the issue related to the challenge, and offers a solution. It is
important to focus on common problems, urgent problems, expensive problems, and frequent
problems. Explaining your problem in these terms is crucial to a good proposal so it should be
the first thing seen by voters. A good problem statement has four components: the desired
outcome, blocking problem, costs of the problem, and the evidence.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="structure-of-the-problem-statement">Structure of the problem statement&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Desired outcome:&lt;/strong> This paints a picture of the ideal set of circumstances once your
solution is accepted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Blocking problem:&lt;/strong> A concise explanation of the problem preventing this set of circumstances from occurring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Costs of the problem:&lt;/strong> A summation of both the opportunity and financial costs of the problem to key stakeholders. This helps voters assess how much impact the problem has.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Evidence:&lt;/strong> Support for your position laid out in a detailed plan. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Statement Component&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Description&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;em>Desired Outcome&lt;/em>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>We want to make it affordable to transfer money to workers living in the Philippines.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;em>Blocking problem&lt;/em>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>11% of the population of the Philippines lose money on transaction fees.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;em>Costs of the problem&lt;/em>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Around $1 billion is paid in transfer fees annually.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;em>Evidence&lt;/em>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Link(s) to data which proves this.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Here’s the complete problem statement which condenses the information above:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Money transfer to Philippines workers should be affordable. However, 11% of the population are losing 1B$ in transaction fees per year. Research links [1],[2]“&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>In Conclusion&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>State your desired outcome and the problem blocking it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define the cost of the problem&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give evidence for your findings&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="solution-140-char-limit">Solution (140 Char limit)&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="structuring-the-solution">Structuring the Solution&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>So, you only have 140 characters to give a lot of important information. When every character counts, it is important that you address the prompt exactly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It may sound obvious, but your solution must be based on a known problem. It has to actually
solve the problem laid out in the problem statement. A solution in search of a problem is rarely
an attractive option because it is less efficient than filling a distinct need. So remember: start
with solving a problem and then lay out the vision of your solution in the &lt;em>Plan in Detail&lt;/em> section.
Your 140 characters should address the problem, solve it, and give some insight into how your
solution is different from others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Example solution statement&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano
in the next 6 months?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Conclusion&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Address the problem directly to ensure that your solution rises to the challenge&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make your project stand out through differentiation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a solution that solves a problem instead of one looking for a problem.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="relevant-experience-140-char-limit">Relevant Experience (140 Char limit)&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="find-your-edge">Find your edge&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Find your ‘competitive edge’ and ensure you drive it home. We can break down your competitive edge into
a couple of different categories. Your solution should include an explanation of as many of these
competitive edges as possible. Remember, the people voting on these proposals want to see yours as a
‘sure thing’. If you can clearly explain why you are different from any of the other projects in the
blockchain space, then you have a significant competitive advantage.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="founders">Founders&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The people who are working on your proposal can lend their personal expertise and work history to the
project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Example Experience:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>John Doe completed his PhD with a focus on incentive schemes for blockchain treasury systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Conclusion*&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Find your competitive edge and make sure that it is well known&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This might look different for different kinds of projects&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remember that your audience is other people on the innovation platform&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="plan-in-detail">Plan In Detail&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="differentiate-through-insight">Differentiate through insight&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Now that we have outlined the problem and given a solid solution, let’s talk about execution. Different problems require different solutions. We are looking for a wide variety of project ideas from marketing campaigns and educational resources to developer infrastructure improvements and business development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should look at your plan as a roadmap and a need analysis. First of all, Why does your solution work? While you may have been the first to identify your problem it is important that you explain why your solution will be the most successful in a field of possible options.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="market">Market&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The market you have identified has not been previously accessed or prioritized. Markets should be identified that have 20 percent growth a year.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Example:&lt;/em> Our hardware solution works with all proof-of-work blockchains.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="product">Product&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Your solution works in the market in a particularly impactful way.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Example:&lt;/em> This hardware addition reduces energy consumption of mining rigs by 20 percent.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="acquisition">Acquisition&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Your route to user and platform acquisition is clear and well thought out.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Example:&lt;/em> Access to network information drives user acquisition for no cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="monopoly">Monopoly&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>As you grow in the field your company actually gets stronger.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Example:&lt;/em> Using the Ouroboros protocol allows our system to become more secure as decentralization increases.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="show-us-the-money">Show us the money:&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Complex problems often need sufficient funding to be solved. This is understood by the community at Project Catalyst. However, anyone voting on these proposals should be able to know how the funding is being spent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Giving a detailed breakdown of how the budget will be spent. This can come in a variety of ways but distilling your budget into a series of line items is a clear way to show voters that you have considered how major funding initiatives will be spent. It is also important to remember that your budget should meet the requirements of the project you’re setting out to accomplish. If you are trying to gain funding for a small meetup then a couple hundred dollars should be sufficient. If you are coordinating the development of critical infrastructure then you will need more resources. Make sure to pair the vision with the appropriate funding.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Example:&lt;/em> Creating a developer focused podcast will take $5k in the initial 6 months.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="getting-on-the-road">Getting on the road&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>When building your proposal, you should write as if you will be receiving funding. But it’s important that anyone reading your proposal understands that you will be able to hit the ground running. This is where your roadmap comes in. Your roadmap should break down all of the key milestones you intend to hit once funding is received. This can be done in a couple of different ways, but a good roadmap details your &lt;em>one month, three month, and six month goals.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the roadmap it is also important to identify your key performance indicators (KPIs). These are the goals that you hit which demonstrate that you have been successful. Here are some examples of KPIs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Users acquired&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Product capability built&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Performance benchmark reached&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Network stability achieved for x amount of time&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The important thing to remember about KPIs is that they should have a number attached to them. Acquiring an initial 15 users is an achievable goal. Acquiring ‘a lot’ of users is pretty vague and difficult for anyone to adjudicate. Remember, you are presenting these ideas to the community, the clearer you make your intentions and the easier it is to verify that you have achieved your goals, the more likely it is that you will be seen as a great bet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Please share with reviewers what is your IP policy (Patents, trademarks, copyright, licensing etc’) so they can assess if that is a good fit for the treasury.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="defining-success">Defining Success&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>What does success look like for this particular project? While it might not be entirely complete after one round of funding, your proposal should give us an idea of what an end state looks like. This, like your KPIs should be an easily understood number that can be verified by anyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Suit the budget and the roadmap to the needs of your project.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establish reachable key performance indicators that show good progress towards your
goal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establish intellectual property rights so that everyone knows who owns what.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define success for your project.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="attachmentslinks">Attachments/links&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is important for everyone to be able to share additional necessary information. That is why
PDFs, images and additional URLs can be sent through the Ideascale where they can be viewed
by everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="feedback">FeedBack&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="community-support">Community support&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In order to make each individual proposal as strong as possible we encourage everyone to use
the innovation platform to discuss each idea. In fact, we’ve created reviewer guidelines to help
you direct your critique. For a productive and informative conversation we encourage everyone
to focus their feedback on the following areas:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Auditability:&lt;/em> What details are missing from the proposal to help reviewers
accurately assess the project?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Impact:&lt;/em> How can the proposal better address the challenge? How can we
encourage people to build dApps on Cardano in the next 6 months?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Feasibility:&lt;/em> What are ways that the proposal’s budget, plan, and scope can be
modified in order to make it more achievable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Example&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If your marketing initiative gave the exact number of users it was attempting to
onboard as a KPI then it would be much easier to track its success.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="in-conclusion-1">In conclusion*&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Make other proposals stronger by giving good feedback&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Incorporate useful feedback into your own proposal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Participate actively in the innovation process to make sure it continues to grow&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="how-to-write-a-community-choice-proposal">How To Write a Community Choice Proposal&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="emancipating-the-community">Emancipating the community&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The purpose of having the Project Catalyst community write their own challenge is to
emancipate the platform from the Project Catalyst team. Eventually, the Cardano community will
control the innovation and collaboration process from inception to delivery. With that in mind, it
is crucial that we understand what an impactful challenge looks like.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="focus-on-advancement">Focus on advancement&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The challenge is a question which helps the community focus its creativity on advancing the
Cardano ecosystem. Of course, ‘advancement’ means different things to different people. The
key to writing an impactful challenge question is balance. It must be broad enough to be
addressed in multiple ways, but specific enough to enhance the value of Cardano for everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="challenge-question-examples">Challenge question examples&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Below are a couple examples of challenge questions:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Too Specific&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How can stake pool operators based in southern Europe make their pool more
attractive delegators in the next 2 months?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This challenge question addresses only stake pool operators in Southern Europe. Cardano is a
global ecosystem which allows participation in many different ways. The challenge question
should help everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Too Broad&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How can we make Cardano more useful?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Of course, we want Cardano to be more useful but this challenge doesn’t give the participants
any parameters to spark their creativity. Constraints are necessary to help the community
address the direct needs of the ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Just Right&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How can we encourage entrepreneurs to develop businesses on Cardano in the
next six months?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This challenge has a time frame and addresses a community which is important to the entire
Cardano community. Furthemore, it can be addressed in many different ways through both
technical and non-technical contributions. However, writing challenge questions is only one
important part of Project Catalyst. Addressing those challenges in a clear and concise manner
is also necessary to identifying the most impactful ideas for Project Catalyst.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tags">Tags&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Please add tags to your proposal if you are looking for collaborators/advice/implementers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Another Tutorial</title><link>/docs/tutorials/tutorial2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/tutorials/tutorial2/</guid><description>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Requested Amount (USD):&lt;/strong> $250,000&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenge-question">Challenge question:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>How do we grow the Cardano ecosystem in East Asia in an inclusive and supportive way? The same way we do in Africa, focused initiatives!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-is-it-important">Why is it important?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Cardano community leans heavily toward North America and Europe. Growth elsewhere requires our support and initiative as a community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-does-success-look-like">How does success look like?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A broad spectrum of people across Asia and connected to Asia, coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-metrics-to-measure">Key Metrics to measure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves some questions about the quality of participation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The number of proposals originating from East Asian participants in Project Catalyst&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The quantity and quality of funded proposals originating from East Asian teams.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The observed impact of funded projects (meeting their KPIs).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Did we increase the participation of the Cardano community and Catalyst teams with East Asian residents?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Was there an increase in Daily/Monthly Active Wallets (DAW/MAW) as a proxy measure of momentum and engagement&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Did we increase the number of Stake Pools and Stake Pool Operators based in East Asia?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We will also be asking some specific questions about the quality of the proposals.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Is there good feedback on funded project progress, failure or success, that help us understand the nuances of deploying Cardano solutions across East Asia?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the novelty and appropriateness of solutions?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are we on track to improve the lives of people using Cardano in East Asia?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Was social and environmental impact evaluation used to measure proposal performance?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the sustainability of proposals beyond the scope of Catalyst?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="challenge-brief">Challenge brief&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As in Africa, raising the awareness levels of regular people in East Asia about blockchain and the Cardano network should be a priority for the Catalyst community. In this challenge, we provide funding for people who have learned about Cardano to take advantage of the community&amp;rsquo;s support and build on or use the Cardano network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nature of the proposals for this challenge is open-ended. Their only requirement is to originate or focus on East Asia and include east Asian team members or focus on East Asian participants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For instance, the overwhelming majority of Stake Pools reside in North America and Europe. The Cardano network will be more resilient when Stake Pools are evenly distributed across the globe. The Catalyst community needs to step up and intentionally make that happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cardano started life in East Asia (Japan and Hong Kong), and Emurgo focuses on East Asia. Let&amp;rsquo;s build upon that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-this-is">What this is:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A call to action; Activate the Cardano community&amp;rsquo;s ability to recognise, reward the opportunity to make the world a better place. East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Addressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. When the challenge succeeds, the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the benefits many of us were born with—allowing others with fewer privileged circumstances to rise and succeed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenge-team">Challenge Team&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This proposal seeks to include a challenge team. Unfortunately, the proposer&amp;rsquo;s have not had time to fully form a challenge team before the proposal goes into review. If possible, we intend to help form that team before voting commences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following individuals have offered to be on the challenge team.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Felix Weber (&lt;a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/pmd/3077912-48088?">@felixweber&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Robert O&amp;rsquo;Brien (&lt;a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/pmd/3056857-48088?">@wolstaeb&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The role of Challenge Teams is to steward the challenges in Catalyst - to present the challenge, track the progress, and report back to the community their perspective on whether the challenges were addressed.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="detailed-plan">Detailed plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Eastern Townhall is a community-driven initiative growing Cardano in the Eastern Hemisphere and across Asia. We want to build a truly global economy and society. Our focus is on making the hard, possible. A place, a time, and a space where:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We can build knowledge, share information, connect and support each other.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Language and culture are not an barrier to participation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We learn how to apply the technology, and community, to address local needs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Show how to use Cardano to increase our economic wellbeing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enrich Cardano&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem with our stories, our energy, and our perspectives.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The eastern hemisphere, East and Southeast Asia region unite culturally and linguistically a lot of countries. With a population of over 1.6 Billion, our goal is to grow Cardano.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="current-problems-and-limitation">Current Problems and Limitation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Eastern Townhall is the result of individuals and groups working together. Each bringing a unique quality. We interact in and around the Cardano Community, focused on linking individuals and projects to Project Catalyst. But this takes time, effort, and incurs expenses. Having no pool of funds to draw upon limits what we can achieve.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="proposed-solution-pool-of-funds">Proposed Solution: Pool of Funds&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To reach a global audience means meeting people where they are, in their country, their language and their culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are an active part of our Cardano ecosystem. Our cornerstone event is the weekly Eastern Townhalls. But we are doing more, so much more:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We make knowledge and content accessible to as many cultures as possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We host different events where community members come together&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We bridges to underrepresented groups&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We integrate local perspectives to enrich the Catalyst Community; and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We listen! Gathering opinions and data to help us all understand.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We are doing translations, building community, sharing knowledge, enabling entrepreneurs, and growing Cardano.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doing all that has costs, so if we are to sustain the Eastern Townhall efforts, then we need to secure funding in a way that does not add extra effort to what we are already doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This proposal is about forming and maintain a pool of funds (a treasury) that is managed by the Eastern Townhall Trusted Seed. A pool of funds to spend at our discretion. The treasury will be used to cover expenses, to grow and sustain the efforts of the Eastern Townhall. Expenses like translation bounties; production of content; paying for online service subscriptions such as Zoom, Github, HackMD, Statbot and others; paying for activities related to organising the Eastern Town Hall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simply put this proposal is about funds for organising a community group. Establishing a resource and distributed support structure that provides funds needed on demand without the overhead of specific Catalyst proposals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In return, we promise to report back financial statements on our activities and expenses. Translated into as many languages as we can find collaborators for. Our intent is to pioneer and prototype DAO treasury management[3] reporting. That is not a small matter and managing a shared pool of funds has plenty of compliance complications. The reporting effort is Similar in principal to the work being done by index.coop[4] and FWB[5]. Most DAOs are still figuring this out and the best practices are not even drafts, so help us work this out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Learning how the Eastern Town Hall is spending and allocating funds will help us attract future funding. Help collaborators identify opportunities to work with us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Help us scale and reach more people across the Eastern Hemisphere.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="kpi-measurement-method-and-goals">KPI measurement method and goals&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A questionnaire on the number of proposers / voters / advisors is conducted for each &lt;strong>fund&lt;/strong> in the community of the target country. The goal is to grow participation by 20% for each fund in the next 6 months. See our work on Catalyst Fund6 submission phase analysis[6] as a base line example.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="activities-to-reach-kpis">Activities to reach KPIs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Daily&lt;/strong>: Inquiries from the community about Catalyst are answered by our members in their respective languages. We will translate Catalyst content and publish it via our website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Weekly&lt;/strong>: We hold weekly planning events and meetups, sharing information about our activities with each community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Monthly&lt;/strong>: Our spending is reported. We will manage your finances in a decentralized manner using a multi-sig wallet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>By Fund&lt;/strong>: Surveys will be conducted in each eastern community to count the number of voters, proposers and experts in each region.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="details-and-costs-to-implement">Details and costs to implement&lt;/h3>
&lt;h3 id="budget-areas">Budget Areas&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Attendance at weekly project planning meetings that activate Eastern Hemisphere: 20 people x 2 hours x 4 weeks x 6 months x $ 15: &lt;strong>$14,400&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Financial management, progress management, monitoring and reporting activities, other new member recruiting activities, etc .: $ 500 x 6 months = &lt;strong>$3,000&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Common expenses: Expenses incurred across multiple projects (domain name, hosting costs, Zoom): &lt;strong>$1,000&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Total: (1) ＋ (2) ＋ (3): $18,400&lt;/p>
&lt;p>▲ Discount: $8,400&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Billed: $10,000&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further funding requirements in future funds will be required to maintain KPIs that support Cataslyt&amp;rsquo;s success in the Eastern hemisphere&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have already started this activity and will continue to do so whether or not this funding is raised.We gave a 45.6% discount to free up funds for a wider project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>NOTE&lt;/strong>: The funds directly required for each activity, such as East Asian entrepreneurial events in the Eastern Hemisphere, meetups, translation activities, theme setting and management, etc., are not in the category of funds required for this proposal.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Challenge:&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="/catalyst/fund6/challenges/fund7-challenge-setting/campaign-brief/">Fund 7 Challenge Setting&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/SoFi-Social-Finance/368902-48088">&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Proposal-Catalyst-blue" alt="Catalyst Proposal Badge">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Requested Amount (USD):&lt;/strong> $250,000&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenge-question">Challenge question&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What solutions can we build on Cardano to finance social and environmental innovation?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-is-it-important">Why is it important?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To address the climate emergency and the associated economic challenges, we need to build resilient financial solutions for driving change.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-does-success-look-like">How does success look like?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Impact investors, NGOs, and grassroots communities make Cardano the default choice to help transparently deliver the greatest impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-metrics-to-measure">Key Metrics to measure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves some guiding questions about the quality of developed solutions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Are we on track to improve the lives of people using them?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How much financial capital is deployed to grassroots community efforts?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How many gaps are filled along the impact investing value chain?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Have we increased capital efficiency and lowered financing costs compared with current approaches?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are the solutions using Cardano&amp;rsquo;s technical features to the fullest?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do teams adopt high-assurance engineering practices to develop code we can trust?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How decentralised is the solution and where are the points of control?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>At the moment there are very few usage metrics addressing Social &amp;amp; Environmental Finance (SoFi) scenarios. This challenge, therefore, will determine uptake by adopting some metrics from Decentralised Finance (DeFi) markets as a guide.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Daily/Monthly Active Wallets (DAW/MAW) - Measure of momentum and engagement&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Average Order Value - Measures who are using services, how much and how often.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Total Value Locked (TLV) - Measure of confidence in DeFi market protocols.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take Rate (Rake) - Measure of efficiency&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) - Total value of services transacted.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We will also be asking some specific questions about the proposals.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What is the sustainability of proposals beyond the scope of Catalyst?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Was social and environmental impact evaluation used to measure proposal performance?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="challenge-brief">Challenge brief&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This challenge is about the ways we can spark a fire under impact investing using the Cardano ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Impact investments are made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside financial returns. While a variety of projects push for the adoption of DeFi on Cardano, can we bring to market the potential of DeFi mechanisms as a vehicle for social good?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Delivering an outcome that has an impact is a lot harder than just delivering a financial Return-on-Investment, even a small one. Impact investing (according to the World Economic Forum) is hindered by:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The lack and/or high cost of trustworthy data on the social or environmental results of investment, making credible accounting of impacts difficult.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Challenges around the “attribution” of impact – meaning the allocation of an impact-related claim to an investor risks “double-counting.”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Roadblocks in monetizing impacts – illiquid impact markets, uncertain returns, high transaction costs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Propose market solutions, financial mechanisms, or means of measuring impact. Think about how these can be deployed at scale to affect positively millions of people. Think about how the results of your proposal can be embedded or reused in different market contexts, or integrated with existing providers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Igniting impact investment on Cardano will provide capital to address the world’s most pressing challenges in sectors such as sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, conservation, microfinance, and affordable and accessible basic services including housing, healthcare, and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To achieve impact requires cooperation and collaboration, something Cardano can enable. Could the answer to better managing the world’s resources lie not in government or big investors but instead in technologies that empower peer-to-peer assistance. Community-based finance or data-driven crowdfunding for instance. How can we leverage the awesome power of the Cardano ecosystem to be that catalyst?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Catalyst: Connect East Asian Entrepreneurs</title><link>/catalyst/fund6/eth-proposals/connect-east-asian-entrepreneurs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/catalyst/fund6/eth-proposals/connect-east-asian-entrepreneurs/</guid><description>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Requested Amount (USD):&lt;/strong> $20,000&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="problem-statement">Problem statement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are no initiatives to attract and engage East Asian entrepreneurs where they are, in their local language.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="describe-your-solution-to-the-problem">Describe your solution to the problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Use the Eastern Town Hall &amp;amp; targeted virtual events to establish and support a network of East Asian entrepreneurs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="relevant-experience">Relevant experience&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Co-Founders of Catalyst Swarm, Eastern Townhall, Catalyst School. IT &amp;amp; Software Engineering. Educators and accountant in East Asia &amp;amp; Japan.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="detailed-plan">Detailed plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We want to reach the massive untapped potential of East Asian entrepreneurs. Meet them where they are, in their country, their language and their culture. The Eastern Townhall wants to establish a growing network of East Asian entrepreneurs. Where they can build knowledge, share information, connect and support each other. Thinking global, acting local.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="current-problems-and-limitation">Current Problems and Limitation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Recall a moment when you realised if you poked something, pushed it or moulded it, something new and interesting popped out the other side. We&amp;rsquo;re here again and this time on a global scale. We, the Cardano Catalyst community are pioneers in a new mindset. A new way of governing and funding. But to make a dent in the universe we need entrepreneurs. People are willing to take a risk, to poke, to push, and to mould new ways of doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reaching Entrepreneurs is difficult when language and cultural barriers exist. Local context may also have undeveloped startup funding programmes too. This can result in unrealized startup funding opportunities. Few East Asian entrepreneurs are aware of the opportunities and the technical, economic benefits of Cardano; Nor is there a full understanding of how to apply Cardano technology within local communities to address local market opportunities. We want to change that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="proposed-solution-cardano-startup-month">Proposed Solution: Cardano StartUp Month&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This proposal is about running virtual events in January/February 2022 to develop entrepreneurs in Vietnam and Indonesia. The event aims to upskill entrepreneurs to develop market opportunities based on Cardano.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The purpose of the event is to build startup founders and Distributed Autonomous Organisation (DAO) collaborators.&lt;/strong> We are not building startups! Our intent is to educate. Focusing on experience-based learning by providing a soft way for the general public to access entrepreneurship and blockchain technology without risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The event will happen over four weeks:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Virtual Networking (Week 1 &amp;amp; 2):&lt;/strong> The first two weeks of the event is about Networking. Getting registered participants to meet each other, discuss their ideas and aspirations. Tutorial sessions will be held to help upskill and familiarise people with business design tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Pitch and Team-Up (Start of Week 3):&lt;/strong> All participants come together for the opening event where individual participants can give a 60-second pitch of a project idea they want to pursue. People vote with their feet by choosing to join a team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Learn and Work (Week 3 &amp;amp; 4)&lt;/strong>: Over the next two weeks, teams start working together. Mentors are assigned. Special sessions are run with experts. Teams are encouraged to validate their ideas with potential customers. Throughout the two weeks, each team will have four 30min pitch sessions with a panel of mentors that help them refine their pitch and Catalyst Proposal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Pitch (End of Week 4)&lt;/strong>: All participants come together for the closing event. The pitch! Each team is given five minutes to present their market problem and their solution to a panellist that ask questions. To pitch every team must have submitted their proposal to Catalyst. When all presentations are given the audience will pick the winning teams. Prizes will be awarded. We all celebrate! At the conclusion of Fund 8, Catalyst Voters choose who to fund.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The event will focus on Cardano Blockchain solutions and place emphasis on using Business Model Generation, Customer Development approaches and the use of analytical tools like Lean Startup, the Platform Design Toolkit, and Wardley Mapping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the time proposals are submitted in Fund 8, entrepreneurial teams will have formed, worked together, finished customer testing, and developed robust business models.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-success-looks-like">What Success Looks Like&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The event is planned to finish on conclusion of the second week of Catalyst fund 8, Feburary 2022. Teams will be submitting proposals to Catalyst Fund 8 as part of their work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of the event, at least 15 teams have managed to complete the process and submitted proposals to Catalyst Fund 8. Individuals complete the event with new skills, connections, and inspiration to continue their Cardano journey.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="key-performance-indicators">Key Performance Indicators&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>For Entrepreneurs Startup Month, participation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Reaches 100 individuals that form into at least 20 teams.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At least 15 teams submit proposals.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>At the end of the event:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We have increased our social media presense by 1000 followers.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="detailed-plan">Detailed plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Voting on how Catalyst spends the treasury creates long-term value to ADA, but with so many proposals, with so many new concepts, how do we make any voting decision? Now imagine how difficult it must be when you do not speak English. All Ada holders benefit if we develop better more inclusive and diverse governance processes and strategies. Unless the Catalyst Community and Ada holders level up our collective cognition, a random voting strategy is just as valid as a well researched one.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="current-problems-and-limitation">Current Problems and Limitation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Language differences and cultural exclusivity prevents governance initiatives from scaling globally. The constant experimentation of Catalyst means we need to be mindful to include different languages and cultures. Avoiding one culture dominating the narrative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Misaligned incentives, scams and information overload prevent Ada holders from voting. In Asia and other non-native English speaking cultures, language barriers compound this. Language barriers are evident at every Catalyst stage. Survey results showed in the Japanese community biggest problem of Catalyst voting was the lack of Japanese support (45.61%). Over %37 of respondents highlighted issues with understanding the process- &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the meaning because it was in English, so I voted randomly&amp;rdquo;. The weariness of scams and lack of trust between proposals and voters were highlighted too. Another %16 mentioned incentive misalignment issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="our-solution-eastern-townhall-goverance-forum">Our solution: Eastern Townhall Goverance Forum&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our goal is to establish a process, format, and event stage for voter and proposer onboarding. To bring voters, proposers, and proposals closer together. To establish trust between them. The focus is on six mutually reinforcing areas:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Content production&lt;/strong>: Help Ada holders understanding why it is important to vote on proposals.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Eastern Hemisphere Language-specific events&lt;/strong> focused on voter education and discussion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A proposal &lt;strong>language translation pipeline&lt;/strong> to help proposers reach the wider East Asian community.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Language-specific Catalyst Swarm Ideafests&lt;/strong> as a stage for building voter awareness, engagement, and trust.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Social Media Marketing&lt;/strong>: socialise voter content and messaging across our social media channels; and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Conduct &lt;strong>routine surveys and user research&lt;/strong> to help understand individual attitudes to Catalyst and proposal formats.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The proposal is seeking funds to help develop a programme specifically designed to help connect voters with proposals and proposers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Together these activities form a programme we call the &lt;strong>Eastern Townhall Forum&lt;/strong>. Our cornerstone event is the weekly Eastern Townhalls. But we are doing more. We are doing translations, building community, sharing knowledge, educating, enabling entrepreneurs, and growing Cardano.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Eastern Townhall trusted seed are an active part of our Cardano ecosystem. Listening and engaging with members of the community. Sharing what we learn. For instance &lt;strong>Yuta Yuta&lt;/strong> recently completed one of his many surveys of the Japanese community[1] that this proposal draws upon. We want to do more of this across all the communities. We would like to help improve the user experience for voters. Feeding our collective insights back into Project Catalyst.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Help us improve decision making across the Eastern Hemisphere by making Catalyst voting more accessible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-success-looks-like">What Success Looks Like&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Participation in Eastern Townhall events has increased and maintains the vibrancy of the new and regular community members. More Catalyst proposers engage with the Asian community. Even if that is just translation of proposals, content, or DApps for the Asian markets. Additionally, Asian proposers find their crowd. They are able to be funded because there is a strong body of Asian voters participating in Catalyst. Survey results show an increase in voter engagement with proposers, the Catalyst process, and deliberations before voting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="key-performance-indicators">Key Performance Indicators&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our primary tool for measuring performance is our voter survey. We will conduct these on a regular basis across Asian countries. Based on the surveys during and after a fund we expect to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Increase Asian voter participation by 30% from the previous funds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Increase Asian participation in Catalyst by 20% from the previous fund.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Uncertainty around Catalyst and voting decreases 25% from the previous fund.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The Eastern Townhall Meetup is our primary stage where Ada holders and people interested in Cardano can come and meet community members. Through that platform and social media, people learn and feel comfortable going further. Therefore key engagement metrics indicate our success in bridging voters and proposers together:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Easter Townhall meetup average weekly numbers increase 25% for each fund.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Catalyst Proposals available in four languages &lt;em>(ID, JP, KR, VN)&lt;/em> increase 50% for each fund.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eastern Townhall Social Media accounts increase followers by 1000 new followers in six months.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="after-one-month">After One Month:&lt;/h4>

&lt;h2 id="problem-statement">Problem statement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Despite a population of billions, East Asians are underrepresented in Catalyst due to a lack of localised content.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="describe-your-solution-to-the-problem">Describe your solution to the problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Setup a translation pipeline that will translate catalyst documentation &amp;amp; proposals across as many languages in East Asia as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="relevant-experience">Relevant experience&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Co-Founders of Catalyst Swarm, Eastern Townhall, Catalyst School. IT &amp;amp; Software Engineering. educators and accountant in East Asia &amp;amp; Japan.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="detailed-plan">Detailed plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>East Asia and Southeast Asia region unites culturally and linguistically diverse countries. People in these communities are excited about getting involved in the Cardano ecosystem. Despite having a population of 1.6 Billion, Catalyst has seen very few proposals from East Asia and Southeast Asian regions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="current-problems-and-limitation">Current Problems and Limitation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Across East Asia and Southeast Asian regions, English is not routinely spoken and a web of regional languages are used [1].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/JFsp5WD.png" alt="English Proficiency Index: www.ef.com/epi">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Language barriers reduce participation in Catalyst. It limits the potential growth of Cardano adoption and utility in this region. We experience this, we hear this from our communities. We know Cardano is missing our stories, our energy, and our perspectives of how to use Cardano to increase economic wellbeing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="proposed-solution-translation-pipeline-and-automation">Proposed Solution: Translation Pipeline and Automation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our objective is to build and document a streamlined process for content translation and start the development of localised content. We have already set up a simple translation pipeline[2] using Git, Hugo, and Github Actions. We&amp;rsquo;ve tested several translation services such as Crowdin[3], Lokalize[4], PoEditor[5], and GitLozalise[6] for the Eastern Townhall to help us organise and gain some experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our initial objective is simple: to get a lot of existing Cardano and Catalyst material translated into as many languages of the East and Southeast Asian regions using a semi-automated system. Gaining experience and building community. Documenting what we do and how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By semi-automated system, we do not mean machine translation. While Machine translation is helpful as a starting point, it has difficulty with specialised terms and does not read naturally. Human translations will always have a slight advantage. A semi-automated system refers to an ability to queue a piece of work for translation, which may include feeding it through a machine translation service, have it worked on by someone, reviewed, and then published.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will start to embrace and extend the excellent localisation documentation processes established by Kubernetes SIG Docs group[7] to help us. Adapting the processes to accommodate the varying technical skills and future directions we want to take.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="work-streams">Work Streams&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To establish a functioning and sustainable translation pipeline, we are seeking initial funding to help develop the work we have already started. The funding will cover five workstreams:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Evaluation of translation services and their integration:
with Git, Github, Ideascale, and the Markdown-based documentation efforts of the Cardano Foundation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Design, configuration, testing of a translation pipeline:
The goal is to have a small scale process in place that is easy enough to follow and requires minimal supervision.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Documenting translation process &amp;amp; development of tutorial material:
Embrace and extend the Kubernettes SIG Doc[7] processes to help with our own needs. Developing localised tutorial content to onboard future translators.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Train the trainers:
Run training sessions with Eastern Townhall members to a level of competence in the process such that they can train others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Translations:
Getting up to speed on our workflow is going to require some hands-on tinkering and experience. We aim to translate a selection of Catalyst Guides, Community Advisor, voter education and our own material. That takes time and effort for each language.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="getting-scale-earn-to-learn">Getting Scale: Earn-to-Learn&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To get true scale, translations and localisation standards, automation, and skills need to be developed so we can outsource localisation to the wider Cardano community. Doing translation and localisation work as a way to get more involved in Cardano and the different communities. Doing translation and localisation work; learning and earning. Doing translation and localisation work to build a reputation and earn Ada. We see a future that leverages Metadata, Native Assets, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), Machine-Learning, and Atala Prism on the Cardano blockchain to give us language and cultural reach. However, starting simply first.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Translation and localisation of content is a general issue across many groups working in Cardano and Catalyst. We do not plan to do this work alone or exclusively. In the Eastern Town Hall, we are at the forefront of managing many languages and cultures, our plan is to develop practices and automated processes for our own purposes, and share them widely. Everything we learn and do, we hope will inform the Cardano ecosystem at large.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-success-looks-like">What Success Looks Like&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Near-term the Eastern Townhall is able to translate and host Catalyst Proposals as they are finalised. Translated for our four initial languages in the Asian region. Funded project reports are integrated and translated too. We have also translated, and maintain those translations, of key Cardano and Catalyst documents and guides.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mid-term we would like to expand the languages translated, and we are actively working with other groups across the Cardano Ecosystem to do this work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Longer-term success means we&amp;rsquo;ve established a whole decentralised workflow for translation and interpretation of any document, video, podcast etc. using the Cardano Network as the coordinating backbone. Where one of the simplest ways to onboard and earn ADA in the Cardano ecosystem system is to help translate, transcribe or interpret material (no harm in dreaming big!).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="key-performance-indicators">Key Performance Indicators&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since we are using Git, and Github for the Eastern Townhall planning, organisation, documentation, metrics are derived from Github activity and engagement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Key Metric&lt;/strong>: Project Velocity[8], defined as a combination of base activity metric of commits and pull-requests taken from Github.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Activity Metrics&lt;/strong>: captured as project activity in Github and cadence documents added and the speed of translation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Community Metrics&lt;/strong>: engagement behaviours broken down into four categories[9] for the Eastern Townhall website, to measure how our work is being spread and used in the Cardano ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="after-one-month">After One Month:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Eastern Townhall website information architecture has been developed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Primary content for the initial website has been identified and ported to Markdown.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The entire Eastern Townhall website is translated.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="after-three-months">After Three Months:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We have established a semi-automated translation pipeline driven by Git Pull requests.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Evaluated and tested different translations services as a means to simplify translation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Documented our initial translation process and trained the trainers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Expanded formats for translations to include video subtitles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Issuing NFTs for skills, language, and attribution/contribution tracking.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="after-six-months">After Six Months:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>On-boarding more members of the Cardano Community to do translations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added two more Eastern hemisphere languages to our core set.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tutorial material (documentation and videos) is developed and translated to help onboard new contributors and languages.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="after-twelve-months">After Twelve Months:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>All Catalyst Proposals and Funded Projects are translated and published within days of being produced.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have expanded our core language set to include the ten languages from the Eastern hemisphere.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The translation project is self-sustaining because projects/teams/businesses want to reach our audience in their native language.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Cardano ecosystem coalesce around similar standards for document management and their translations.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="licensing">Licensing&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Code, documentation, project activity is made available on Github or in the future a similar service.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="budget">Budget&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The requested Fund 6 budget is for wages for three months and six months of expenses. Fifty per cent of funds will be used retrospectively to cover work and expenses we are already undertaking.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Evaluation/Integration of Translation services: $1200 USD&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Workflow Automation: $3000 USD&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Process Documentation: $2200 USD&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Train the Trainers: $850 USD&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Translations: $1250 USD&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Project Management (%8): $1000 USD&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Software Services &amp;amp; Servers: $3000 USD&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Software Services &amp;amp; Servers fees ($500 x 6 months = $3,000) includes the expenses of using a translation service (anywhere from $140USD to $240USD a month) to help streamline translations; Github; website hosting and any servers needed for translation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This funding only concerns setting up and testing a translation pipeline. Further funds will be requested to continue any work beyond the three month period, either through Catalyst or other means of funding the Eastern Townhall activity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Startup innovation and co-creation is the lifeblood of Cardano. Many early stage ventures are now launching into the Cardano ecosystem and Catalyst wants to fuel many pioneering successes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More needs to be done to accelerate best of breed Catalyst-funded projects by providing pathways into professional business support, investment, and mentoring programmes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is important to Catalyst because great ideas need to be nurtured and small teams need access to timely expertise and tools beyond those that they have in-house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This challenge seeks professional-grade Accelerator programmes and Business Incubators to step up, co-develop, and deliver venture building programmes with Catalyst. The objective is to help catalyse early successes of Catalyst-funded projects and turn them into highly investable ventures. This helps projects funded by the community to get a fast track to resources and expertise that will help teams build invaluable know-how and strategy by plugging gaps in their current capabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key to this challenge is the alignment of the proposal to the challenge? And how will success be measured during the scope of the project and beyond?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Proposers should give strong consideration to providing evidence of their experience and history of success and also provide Catalyst voters and reviewers supporting information about the project&amp;rsquo;s operational approach to delivering the objectives previously stated. The more detail the better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We anticipate that a number of proposals that address this challenge will be funded in Fund 7 and we hope the community takes a portfolio approach to select projects from different parts of the world or a variety of themes relevant to the adoption of Cardano-based projects and the Cardano ecosystem as a whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-is-it-important">why is it Important?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Knowledge is power and enabling project&amp;rsquo;s to tap into to a distributed network of professional mentors and supporters will enable ventures to grow stronger and faster. Catalyst wants organizations and groups who have a track record of business incubation and acceleration to apply.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-does-success-look-like">How does success look like?&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Access to financial, human, and intellectual capital to fuel the success of Catalyst-funded projects&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Fund Size: &lt;strong>$100,000 USD paid in Ada&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26256">Campaign page&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/ideas/top/campaign-filter/byids/campaigns/26256/stage/unspecified">browse ideas&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>COTI has developed, together with a very productive and successful partnership with Cardano, a very user-friendly and scalable ADA payment solution for the community. As a result, different online merchants, from a small hotel in Europe to a big e-commerce website in Asia, can easily accept hundreds or thousands of ADA transactions when integrating ADA Pay into their site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Catalyst, we are offering an innovative technical challenge to our communities to allow a new and creative way for all small and medium enterprises currently using platforms, such as Shopify and WooCommerce, to readily accept ADA Payments with seamless integration by adding a plug-in into their site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, ADA Pay currently provides the ability to send a separate payment request to each payment attempt, allowing merchants to effectively identify each client without requiring the customer&amp;rsquo;s identity before completing the order. In other words, companies integrating ADA Pay enjoy the ability to send a unique address to a potential customer and be notified at every stage of the payment process via Webhook. Moreover, by registering the payment request on the client&amp;rsquo;s backend, merchants can know who pays for what without disclosing the client&amp;rsquo;s information to a third party.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The teams proceeding with the challenge will be provided with an API Key to the ADA Pay system and complete API documentation of the payment solution. The API Key will allow you to receive and send payments with ADA over the Cardano testnet. The API documentation also includes endpoints to create payment requests, withdraw your funds, and a webhook to notify you of any ongoing activity regarding the payment request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the tools described above, we expect from the teams involved in the challenge to create an innovative plug-in that will be integrated with our current ADA Pay system on the one hand and support all the different e-commerce software mentioned above (Shopify and WooCommerce) on the other.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves: Do we have a simple, flawless, and easy-to-integrate ADA Pay plug-in solution ready to be integrated into different e-commerce platforms?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is the UI and payment flow of the plug-in user-friendly? For example, is the process smooth from when customers add items into their cart until the transaction is complete?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Be creative; the fewer clicks needed to complete a transaction, the better.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-metrics-to-measure">Key Metrics to measure&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Total amount of e-commerce platforms that can be integrated into the new component.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ratio of total transaction attempts and transactions completed, measuring the effectiveness of the payment flow proposed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scalability of the plug-in without compromising the quality of the service.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Number of merchants that can be integrated with the plug-in.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Artificial Intelligence will be a driving force this century. It will be at least as big as cryptocurrencies and blockchains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Singularity community has put their trust in Cardano by voting overwhelmingly to risk the value of their AGI tokens by issuing new AGI tokens based on Cardano and moving swiftly from Ethereum to Cardano. We can reward that trust and recognize the risk they took by dedicating a community challenge to them and their field of endeavor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The speed and efficiency of Cardano combined with the possibilities of SingularityNet will make a great partnership that sets both communities apart from other cryptocurrencies/tokens and drives enormous growth and value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Also… I want a world for my kids and community where Artificial Intelligence&amp;rsquo;s goals are as beneficial and ethical as Cardano&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our challenge is an evolution of the mass decentralized identity (DID) adoption challenge from Funding Round 6, connecting everything we are learning with the first Atala PRISM Pioneer Program cohort.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second cohort of the Atala PRISM Pioneer Program will kick off once Catalyst Fund 7 is complete. Between now and then, any member of the Catalyst Community inspired to write a proposal will get access to the Atala PRISM Pioneer Program first cohort course materials on Canvas. Please submit your proposal on Ideascale, including your email address, to get an invitation to Canvas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this access, you&amp;rsquo;ll join the growing Atala PRISM community. Our Atala PRISM product team and engineers will be available via a dedicated Discord channel. Inclusion in our Professional Services Group governance framework foundry. Access to fireside chats with the top leaders in the SSI space, where we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss trends, use cases, and much more. In addition, we will support the growth of high-value credentials and enable partners from concept, to development, to commercialization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="areas-of-focus">&lt;strong>Areas of focus&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;h5 id="interoperability">&lt;strong>Interoperability&lt;/strong>&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Most digital credentials sit on Hyperledger Indy ledgers, including those issued by governments in Germany, Canada, and the UK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best-performing platform will gain the largest market share. For many reasons, we believe our platform is superior. Therefore, Cardano and Atala PRISM must include a plan to interact with these other ecosystems to maximize market share.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We encourage Catalyst proposals to achieve full interoperability. Deliverables should optimize the user experience (UX) for Atala PRISM credentials while remaining compatible with other platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="self-governance-of-emergent-communities">&lt;strong>Self-governance of Emergent Communities&lt;/strong>&lt;/h5>
&lt;h5 id="dao-governance-in-practice">DAO Governance in Practice&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>New legislation in Wyoming allows for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to be registered with the state. We challenge the community to establish a DAO under the new laws. It could manage an impact or development goal with shared common resources governed by the DAO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are curious to see if our community proposes a DAO. With a funded proposal, we could facilitate introductions to legal experts in Wyoming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The proposal should consider setting aside funds for legal expenses to establish the DAO and legal documentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="patterns-of-commoning">Patterns of Commoning&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>We draw inspiration from the work of the &lt;a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/YOMA+Ecosystem+Task+Force">Trust Over IP Foundation&lt;/a> and the principles from &amp;lsquo;Patterns of Commoning.&amp;rsquo; We see the potential for innovation by linking communities with shared interests under these principles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How can these principles become plug-and-play code as technological primitives that other communities can leverage and unlock exponential growth and adoption?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are interested in exploring a rich playground of ideas and bringing these to real-world implementations on Cardano and Atala PRISM.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="education-career-and-emergent-reputation-primitives">Education, Career, and Emergent Reputation Primitives&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Many of our Pioneer and Catalyst-funded projects support education and career programs. One of the defining characteristics of these approaches is the creation of alternatives to accredited education and career paths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need our community to think about developing technology and governance primitives to support any community that wants to establish new education and career paths by providing tools:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For onboarding new experts and teachers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For people in the community to develop and grow&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For maintaining a reputation as a skilled employee, laborer, consultant, mentor, teacher, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When reputation standards change, we need ways to self-heal and self-monitor for bad actors, harmful actions, or bad outcomes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="circular-supply-chain">&lt;strong>Circular Supply Chain&lt;/strong>&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>The global supply chain focuses on creating a new economic infrastructure. The goal is replacing or integrating with legacy systems such as record-keeping, bills of lading, centrally managed systems of record, and distribution networks. Centralization has many challenges, the least of which is a lack of resilience in the global supply chain, as we have all seen and continue to experience in the COVID era.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Supply chains tend to start as decentralized. Markets and trade routes emerge from the bottom of the producer market and are aggregated into centralized supply chains, eventually working their way down to the consumer. We want to explore new patterns of commerce in bottom-up supply chains that could open and expand the local reputation network into markets that are currently inaccessible, such as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Regenerative agriculture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Locally produced art&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Other forms of local commerce&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>On the other side, distribution or demand-driven commerce has the potential to build a market force from the bottom-up that can engage the industrial global supply chain in ways that are not possible without establishing the voice and economic strength of the community digitally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the supply chain challenge, we want to address two significant challenges:&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="small-producer-problem">Small Producer Problem&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>How can we create transparency as the bottom-up process meets the industrialized supply chains, cuts through the centralized distribution markets, and connects directly to the consumer?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, small producers like a family ranch in Wyoming have no way to get information about the value of their product through these global aggregation and distribution networks. Currently, a solution such as the &lt;a href="https://beefchain.com/">BeefChain project&lt;/a> is supporting small ranchers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are multiple issues to overcome. For example, packaging plants are the entry point to the aggregation, so there is little or no incentive to deal with the small producer. We want to address this problem by building general-purpose tooling to assist communities in self-organizing and self-governing production according to agreed standards. We propose that if these communities can connect and grow, they will either:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reach the market through alternative distribution channels to industrial supply chains
Be able to negotiate as a community for better terms to have the values of their products recognized, distributed, and sold with value intact commercially and reputationally.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="the-last-mile-problem">The Last-Mile Problem&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>How can a local distributor in a local market interact with global industrial supply chains and be given access to the market that otherwise would be inaccessible due to a lack of economic identity or capital to access the goods at the scale required by industrial supply chains?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This challenge deals with distributing necessary products to local communities with little market clout or access to financial tools, such as credit, to interact with the industrial supply chain. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for bottom-up tooling to establish a network of communities. Delegates in those communities can access the finance and credit necessary to interact with the industrial supply chain at the economic scale required for transactions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An example of this problem is delivering health care supplies to rural and developing countries and economies. The funds from donors, the government, and other sources are available for these medical supplies. The donors will only release the funds once delivery is verified, and the medical supply companies will only send the goods to port once payment is received.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, local small businesses must maintain transparency and oversight of the goods during delivery and receiving. These businesses do not have the funds or the ability to borrow capital to cover medical supplies costs from the delivery at the port to the hospitals and clinics that need them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Addressing the challenge of the financial gap is vital. We believe that there is enormous potential to create bottom-up networks of trusted individuals and small businesses to fill this gap.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-is-it-important">Why is it Important?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>How individuals interact with their communities and the broader economy helps us understand which credentials improve their daily lives. By identifying these high-value, high-impact credentials, we can establish governance framework foundries for launching pilot programs and driving growth. Ultimately, this will cause further adoption of Cardano and Atala PRISM technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-does-success-look-like">How does success look like?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Discover repeatable patterns that unlock our ability to leverage the Cardano decentralized infrastructure. Identify high-value credentials and use cases. Once identified, we can form stakeholder governance framework working groups. These groups will allow us to foster the development of community, partner, and vendor ecosystems to launch into commercial and production environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-metrics-to-measure">Key Metrics to measure&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The sum of realized production pilots or launches in 2022&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discovery of repeatable patterns in use-cases&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The number of issuers, holders, and verifiers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The number of verifications performed on credentials in production&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="a-proposed-pattern-language-outline-example">&lt;strong>A Proposed Pattern Language Outline (example)&lt;/strong>&lt;/h4>

&lt;li>Verifiable Presentation Proof&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cryptocurrency&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Non-fungible token (NFT)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Smart Contract&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h5 id="patterns">&lt;strong>Patterns&lt;/strong>&lt;/h5>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Trust Registry&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governance Framework&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Token Curated Registry&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Community member recognition and onboarding process&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establishing Individual Reputation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Community as a whole group Interaction with an external party&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Community member as an individual interaction with an external party&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Community medium of exchange&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recognition of external Trust Registry&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recognition of external Governance Framework&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Acceptance of Governance Framework by an external party&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>With that as background, we are suggesting proposals in the following three areas:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Interoperability between Cardano and Indy anchored DIDs/VCs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Self-governance of Emergent Communities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Circular Supply Chain&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This challenge deals with distributing necessary products to local communities with little market clout or access to financial tools, such as credit, to interact with the industrial supply chain. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for bottom-up tooling to establish a network of communities. Delegates in those communities can access the finance and credit necessary to interact with the industrial supply chain at the economic scale required for transactions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An example of this problem is delivering health care supplies to rural and developing countries and economies. The funds from donors, the government, and other sources are available for these medical supplies. The donors will only release the funds once delivery is verified, and the medical supply companies will only send the goods to port once payment is received.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, local small businesses must maintain transparency and oversight of the goods during delivery and receiving. These businesses do not have the funds or the ability to borrow capital to cover medical supplies costs from the delivery at the port to the hospitals and clinics that need them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Addressing the challenge of the financial gap is vital. We believe that there is enormous potential to create bottom-up networks of trusted individuals and small businesses to fill this gap.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What will drive mass-scale adoption of decentralized IDs on Cardano?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fund Size: &lt;strong>$250,000 USD paid in Ada&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="campaign-brief">Campaign Brief&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Propose a means or way to drive mass-scale adoption of DID usage as an easy-to-use onramp to the Cardano ecosystem (preferably Atala PRISM when released). This can include any method that will offer users or entities a decentralized ID to start defining their digital self-sovereignty. Think about how this is implemented at scale drawing millions of users, who, once onboard, can become customers for dApps, tools, DeFi and other services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are a community of thought leaders and it is time to demonstrate our thoughts with actions. Using a Decentralized Identification (DID) technology to establish self-sovereign presence and ownership of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) advances decentralization of institutions; benefiting individuals and entities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This Challenge is about small ways we can incorporate DIDs into the Cardano ecosystem to start the ground swell at the grassroots that demands PII be secured and controlled with DID technologies and standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is about &lt;strong>signaling to the world&lt;/strong> that the Cardano community plans mass-adoption of DID that is interchangeable, interoperable (by WW DID standards) and &lt;strong>we care deeply that the origin of our personal DID is tied to our home blockchain—Cardano.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While we prefer to support Atala PRISM&amp;rsquo;s instantiation of DID, this is more about building ideas and concepts that require DID to draw users to the Cardano platform. And since PRISM is building to the open standards, those are available for anyone to imagine possibilities and offer proposals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It won&amp;rsquo;t be lost on IOHK how the community responses to this Challenge. Should IOHK see a ground swell of great ideas and proposals, that could help them justify expediting timelines for their planned open sourcing of PRISM components.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-is-it-important">Why is it important?&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>The previous challenge(ScaleUP Cardano&amp;rsquo;s DeFi Ecosystem) demonstrated success and allowed popular DeFi projects such as Liqwid Finance, Minswap and ErgoDEX to be funded by the treasury, without the participation of venture capitals and with fair launch models, allowing sustainable distribution of the supply among the community/userbase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fact that ERGODEX&amp;rsquo;s proposal was the second best voted proposal in the Left-Over budget is an important indicator to demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposals presented in Fund5.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, the vast majority of DeFi dapps and assets flows occur on the Ethereum blockchain, however due to congestion and increased transaction fees, the use of DeFi is increasingly elitized, leaving out the people who could most benefit from it, the unbanked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past year several DeFi projects have been moving to more scalable blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, Solana, among others. Second layer solutions are also being used as alternatives to Ethereum main chain, Polygon has been a great example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this migration and bridges creation scenario, some projects are turning to Cardano to create their DeFi projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cardano is finally delivering smart contracts and that opens a door to a lot of innovation in DeFi. We can offer not only a scalable blockchain, but also a secure blockchain and aggregated governance layer in the near future. This set of characteristics place Cardano in a prominent place and with a good opportunity to gain market share and expand the user base.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Catalyst, we have the opportunity to fund DeFi projects and allow them to have greater decentralization and resilience, which are essential aspects for DeFi projects. Many projects end up accepting the participation of Venture Capitals due to lack of financial resources. The participation of VCs in DeFi projects usually ends up causing a large part of the supply distribution to be alocated to VCs and this compromises the decentralization and consequently the security of these projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DeFi ecosystem today is taken over by projects full of vulnerabilities, hacks are constant, economic models are copied from other projects, decentralization is no longer a priority and few projects are dedicated to create economic models/bonding curves/algorithms thinking about the users&amp;rsquo; needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has become clear over the year that bugs, hacks and vulnerabilities are not unique to smart contracts on Ethereum. Dapps running on Binance Smart Chain and Cosmos suffered from vulnerabilities as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hackers-stole-at-least-600m-in-poly-exploit-across-three-chains">Hackers stole at least $600M in Poly exploit across three chains&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Cardano arrives to change this paradigm and bring security to users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Privacy and resistance to censorship are also important but often overlooked in favor of subsidizing (yield farming). How to encourage DeFi projects to seek resilience, safety, research-based economic models and critical thinking?&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>For years blockchain has held a promise that has not been properly filled. Spot solutions for e.g. traceability, supply chain management, identification and payments have been implemented but large scale benefits of this promising technology are yet to be seen. Based on years of rigorous research and development, Cardano is one of the most serious contenders to fulfill this promise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recent and upcoming technological developments in Cardano—smart contracts, Yoroi dApp connector, larger block size (higher throughput), sidechains and state channels, to name a few—are gearing Cardano to be ready for large scale adoption in 2022.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Large corporations, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), platform businesses and highly networked startups have very different types of needs. Their industries may vary from finance and high-tech to agriculture and construction and from simple services to knowledge-intensive business. Yet, at the end of the day, they all need modern tools to keep fulfilling their mission, to remain relevant in global competition and to offer their employees the best tools to do what they were hired to do. Any company wants to engage their partners and employees, serve their customers better, improve their processes, cut costs, increase revenues and expand to new business areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By removing the middle man and automating processes, smart contract blockchain solutions can drive all of the above. Cardano can at least partly answer to these needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>In this challenge, proposed solutions can be tools, services, products, process improvements, data management solutions (CRM, ERP, MES, DMP etc), decentralized cloud solutions, privacy and security related offerings or even metaverse-related solutions.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In your proposal, it would be good to outline the extent, limits and scope of the solution readiness-level of the solution, and whether it is e.g:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A Feasibility Study, Proof-of-Concept, Minimum Viable Product that could be built on Cardano.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An existing business-ready product or service that could be converted to run on Cardano.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A business-oriented training or consultancy service.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An existing blockchain solution brought into the Cardano ecosystem to serve business needs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A prototype or demo in operational environment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A creation of model of a system or subsystem&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A process improvement&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When submitting proposals, please include the long-term vision, strategy and roadmap as well as short-term deliverables attainable in the next 6-9 months. Visualization and video materials are more than welcome to explain often complex business solutions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Catalyst: Cardano Emerging Threat Alarm</title><link>/catalyst/fund6/challenges/emerging-threats/campaign-brief/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/catalyst/fund6/challenges/emerging-threats/campaign-brief/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Blockchain systems are a complex amalgam of technological, economic and social components that rely and are used by many stakeholders from different geographies and backgrounds. These systems are not isolated from the real world and unexpected threats may emerge from the dynamic interaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cardano stakeholders (users, SPOs, DApp developers, partners, Exchanges, governments, companies) need a resilient system that is able to identify and grade developing threats to its own existence.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-is-it-important">Why is it important?&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>At the end of this challenge, we should be asking ourselves: Did we manage to create a simple mechanism for identifying novel, emerging systemic threats to the Cardano ecosystem?

&lt;p>For Cardano to become a global leader as a smart contract blockchain it will need to scale to meet the requirements of handling hundreds of millions of users.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="current-scaling-situation">Current Scaling Situation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Hydra is the leading project being executed by IOG to help Cardano scale the blockchain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first phase of Hydra will be available in 2022 however this initial implementation will not resolve all of the problems needed for Cardano to scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sebastien from dcSpark recently discussed the importance of rollups and alternative solutions in an interview -&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="need-for-more-scaling-options">Need for more scaling options&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To reach true decentralization the Cardano community will need to not rely on the input from IOG as much as it does now as we move into the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hydra will only have it&amp;rsquo;s initial implementation released early next year. Cardano faces potential scaling problems in 2022 as high demand protocols in DeFi, NFTs and gaming begin and continue being released. With alternative scaling solutions not in place there is a risk of overloading demand on the main chain.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="types-of-proposals-encouraged">Types of proposals encouraged&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Proposers should consider new novel ideas or research, extensions of Hydra functionality or porting over solutions used in other blockchains that would be suitable for Cardano.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Proposers are welcome to focus on market specific scalability solutions - for instance a solution could focus on DeFi specifically with decentralized exchanges (DEX&amp;rsquo;s) as a focus area or other growing markets that could benefit from novel scaling solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scalability topic areas:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Rollups (e.g. zero knowledge rollups, optimistic rollups)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sharding&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Scaling solutions are inherently complex and require significant engineering effort. As a result proposers should not be discouraged from making proposals that request most of the challenge budget. A single proposal team is both welcome and encouraged to request the entire budget if they can demonstrate an articulated plan with the technical expertise to address the challenge of scaling solutions that are suitable for growing Cardano.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Increasing the speed of funding is critically important to allow important projects to move rapidly from volunteers to paid professionals. While volunteerism is strong in our community (and a strength), the ability to pay people for their time will accelerate and dramatically improve the time and energy people will be able to devote to Catalyst.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need to explore alternative ways of scaling how we fairly distribute the treasury to grow the Cardano ecosystem. We should be willing to experiment and try different models in parallel and compare and contrast them.

&lt;p>There are already many community-driven events taking place in the wider Catalyst community and this challenge will ensure that these efforts remain sustainable. Since most of the fund distribution for Fund 7 is decided by the community, we as a community have to create this challenge for ourselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These events are important and critical for the success of Catalyst because they are bringing the community together and they introduce and onboard new people to our ecosystem. Furthermore the community has used these sessions for collaborative problems sensing and also new teams and initiatives were established. Overall, community events give our community its face and personal touch.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The goal of this challenge is to find ways to further engage the Japanese community and to help create ways for the Japanese and English speaking community to connect. Proposers are encouraged to propose in Japanese and the Challenge team will help promote the CA role in the Eastern Town hall or equivalent event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The budget is set to 50k because the Challenge focuses only on a specific part of the community. There are also projects from Japan which have a broad application and will fit in other challenges. Considering the focus is on community building the budget should be enough to support 2-6 meaningful efforts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-is-it-important">Why is it Important?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There has been an interest in Cardano in Japan from the start and the country has had a progressive stance towards blockchain technology. This makes Japan a likely country to adopt solutions built on top of Cardano. There are already some active community members and SPO&amp;rsquo;s but participation in Catalyst is still relatively low.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently an Eastern Town Hall was started by community members and participation in the Japanese breakout room has been among the highest consistently. In the fund 6 challenges there are several proposals coming from the Japanese community as well. With the current momentum a challenge in fund 7 would likely see good participation and can solidify the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the moment most of Ideascale &amp;amp; Catalyst operates in english. This creates a barrier for all non-english communities. If solutions from this challenge prove successful in bridging that gap, they can function as an example for other communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="possible-directions">Possible directions:&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Translating key documentation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Creating educational content about Cardano &amp;amp; Catalyst in Japanese&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Organising workshops for new members, CA&amp;rsquo;s, SPO&amp;rsquo;s, proposers&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The success of Bitcoin spawned numerous off-shoot experiments and the arrival of Ethereum increased tribalism. As the number of altcoins grew, unhealthy &amp;ldquo;maximalism&amp;rdquo; emerged. The future is multi-chain, however, and the cryptoeconomy thrives when interoperability and cross-chain collaboration are cherished and encouraged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are multiple next generation blockchains with cadres of zealous supporters, highly skilled developers and innovative technologies that Cardano and Project Catalyst can learn from. And, vice versa, we can help other networks thrive by offering the good practices developed in Catalyst. IOG has recently formed the UTXO alliance and started collaboration with numerous partners like COTI and SingularityNET. It&amp;rsquo;s a good start but more is needed to address the lack of communication, coordination and collaboration between blockchain communities. Missing awareness of each other&amp;rsquo;s doings forces us to duplicate our efforts. When we are separate we are not able to learn from each other&amp;rsquo;s achievements or failures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cardano has a strong, open and inclusive community, let&amp;rsquo;s make this a real super power and let&amp;rsquo;s be the first ones to forge strong bonds. Let&amp;rsquo;s create an enriching, open and safe environment, where people from different communities can find common ground and share knowledge, resources, skills, ideas and visions with one another. Let&amp;rsquo;s go out there, break the silos and build bridges and presence between us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Here are some examples of potential DLT/Blockchain entities, communities and projects to explore and collaborate with:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cosmos&lt;/strong>, dubbing itself the Internet of Blockchains, makes it easy for other blockchains to connect to it via their Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC). Massive projects like Binance Smart Chain, Terra, Thorchain and Oasis Network are built on the Cosmos SDK.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps">Cosmos Network&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-video-tutorials">Polkadot&lt;/a> (and its canary network &lt;strong>Kusama&lt;/strong>) is a light-weight and quickly updateable design where the Relay Chain offers shared security and cross-chain communication, allowing the connected Parachains to focus on fast deployment of services. Its unique crowdloan mechanism invites the community of token holders to voice out which projects should be implemented first. The Nominated Proof of Stake network offers advanced governance mechanisms as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Academically impressive and technologically sound &lt;a href="https://www.algorand.com/technology">Algorand&lt;/a> has a unique consensus mechanism Pure Proof of Stake and we can learn a lot from their governance model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Boasting a throughput beyond 4,500 tps and near-instant finality, the EVM-compatible Avalanche has quickly become the go-to choice for multiple DeFi projects. It has an innovative multi-chain architecture that utilizes both DAG and Blockchain technologies.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="proposals-you-can-submit-to-this-challenge">Proposals you can submit to this challenge&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is an open-ended challenge that welcomes any proposal geared for cross-chain collaboration, co-innovation and interoperability. These can be any community-led projects, initiatives, solutions, tools or services. It could mean for instance:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>New technical implementations connecting Cardano to other blockchains and vice versa (SDKs, APIs, bridges etc)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governance ideas from other chains implemented as part of the Voltaire road map&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Already successful projects expanding from other chains to Cardano&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Expansion of Cardano-based projects into other chains&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Oracles and other tools to interpret and interact with cross-chain data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Catalyst-created solutions adopted by other chains and communities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Common research, education, outreach and innovation projects with other chains and communities (e.g. podcasts, hackathons, webinars, communication hubs, educational resources)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="challenge-team">Challenge Team&lt;/h3>

&lt;li>Felix Weber is an active Project Catalyst member, Cardano Ambassador and initiator/leader of several community led Projects and initiatives.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="our-assessment-of-the-maturity-of-this-proposed-challenge">Our assessment of the maturity of this proposed challenge:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Cardano technology stack is finally mature enough to start inviting proposals for cross-chain collaboration and interoperability. Our proposed challenge is intentionally left open ended and it welcomes a multitude of different solutions. Worthwhile ideas submitted in this challenge should help grow and improve the Cardano and Catalyst community in the near term (next 6-9 months).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This challenge is therefore aligned with the Fund8 strategic goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It helps prepare people to make contributions to the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystem.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It helps turn Cardano into an open source project recognized also beyond our community.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It accelerates the growth and evolution of our developer &amp;amp; app ecosystem by inviting contributions from the rest of the blockchain space.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The budget of $400,000 USD is a moderate 2,5% of the total treasury allocation for Fund8. It should be sufficient to kickstart interoperability and cross-chain collaboration initiatives but might not be enough for any large scale infrastructure projects. Therefore, &lt;strong>we encourage submission of &amp;ldquo;minimum viable&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;proof of concept&amp;rdquo; proposals that do include long-term vision and roadmap but which are initially scoped quite small&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Catalyst: DAOs ❤ Cardano</title><link>/catalyst/fund7/challenges/daos-love-cardano/campaign-brief/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/catalyst/fund7/challenges/daos-love-cardano/campaign-brief/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Cardano is an ecosystem that sets itself apart through its rigorous research and strives to do things correctly. We expect all dApp projects applying for funding to aspire to the highest possible levels of certification. To understand what this refers to and practically means, please watch Charles Hoskinson&amp;rsquo;s video on this topic: &amp;ldquo;DApp certification and Community Curation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This challenge is suitable for incorporated technology or blockchain companies and larger projects with competent teams that already have deployed MVPs. Ideally, these are projects that have a proven user base. Projects that satisfy such criteria are welcome to apply for more than $100,000 if that can be justified and clearly budgeted for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For smaller teams (4-5 people) with proven competence, relevant experience and technical skills with sketches/whitepaper detailing how they would go about to launch their proposal, the budgets would typically be in the range $40,000-$80,000.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For people with the relevant background but without a full team or completed whitepaper detailing the solution, the project ought to be considered as a research stage project and budgets should less than $10,000.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Liveliness. Happy energized developers making money and achieving their goals, mutual help, collaboration, and a shared feeling of success. A feeling of unexpected innovation happening &amp;ldquo;on it&amp;rsquo;s own&amp;rdquo;. A wide variety of resources are provided for developers allowing them to focus on business value they can generate and not on infrastructure&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cardano has a thriving ecosystem of infrastructure companies that don&amp;rsquo;t need to be subsidized by grants and are able to scale their businesses by monetizing the services that they provide. They are attracting developers to the ecosystem and educating them on how to build applications.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The difference is in the title. While we are advocates of open source, we recognize that not all teams are at the point where they feel comfortable or capable of open sourcing their solutions. Some APIs may be closed source forever, but still provide an overall net positive for the Cardano ecosystem. If you are all-in on open source from day one, definitely go with the Open Source Development Ecosystem challenge (if that&amp;rsquo;s an option). We are rooting for you. We believe, however, there&amp;rsquo;s room for both at this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Catalyst Town Hall from December 1st 2021 had a breakout room dedicated to this discussion. Once it becomes available it shall be attached as a comment.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In a proof of stake system with distributed governance a common understanding of truth and reliance on authentic sources of correct and provable information can be crucial for avoiding a splitting of the community into two or more feuding camps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A distributed denial-of-truth (DDoT) attack could be defined as a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal operations of a community, service or network by overwhelming the target, its surrounding infrastructure and community with a flood of disinformation and malinformation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Disinformation is fabricated or deliberately manipulated audio/visual/text content, intentionally created conspiracy theories or rumors or to sow mistrust. With disinformation the bad information is spread with the intent to deceive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Malinformation is the deliberate publication of information for personal or corporate rather than public interest. Deliberate change of context, date or time of genuine content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These DDoT attack scenarios may emerge as a combined outside/inside attack and spread faster in fiercely tribal communities, such as a cryptocurrency community. A DDoT attack might overwhelm a system with false information, leading to a plunge in confidence / community split.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Right now everybody is implicitly assuming that the only possible victim is an election,&amp;rdquo; says David Perlman, a former Twitter Inc. data scientist who is now developing ways for corporations to counter disinformation at the computer security company Leviathan Security Group Inc. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s no reason that a company couldn&amp;rsquo;t be a victim,&amp;rdquo; he says.*&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A bad faith player may secretly prepare for this scenario out of particular interests that are not publicly visible initially. This can be done with the help of some major holders/exchanges/rival coins/investors and/or media personalities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are all aware how a single person (Elon Musk) is already able to move crypto markets, while a handful of prominent Cardano personas with outside support might be able to do the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Proposers in this challenge would focus on improving the transparency of all segments of Cardano treasury monetary transfers and make &amp;ldquo;beginner-friendly&amp;rdquo; tutorials on how to monitor financial events from the very inception of Cardano and its main founding entities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Proposers would also focus on shining a powerful light on old and new attempts to game the system, further scams, fleece users, sow distrust, spread lies and destabilize the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many possible DDoT scenarios may evolve if the Cardano community is not proactively working to prevent them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One invented - example DDoT scenario to illustrate how things can go wrong fast:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Example scenario involving bad faith: A former/current head or founder or leading researcher/manager of one of the three founding entities of Cardano issues an untrue statement questioning the legitimacy of efforts/intentions of another founding entity or possible financial shenanigans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Several prominent community SPOs side with the accusing entity, as do several leading Youtube influencers and crypto media. Other side with the accused side. Some companies start distancing themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rumors circulate that one founding entity allegedly secretly siphoned funds and that has been done behind the scenes. Another rumor circulates that one of the Cardano entities has installed a backdoor and several SPOs announce they have reduced their pledges out of fear. Panic spreads. The allegations are amplified through social media.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Truth is hard to establish - references are made to talks and private discussions, public allegations are difficult to verify.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The general community has no way to verify the true merits of the claims - as they are undocumented. Two camps emerge. Cardano community splits along fault lines. This adds more fuel to the fire. ADA value plunges. The very sources of truth in the Cardano ecosystem come under question. The entire system teeters. A DDOT attack by a group of two dozen well organized distributed players is underway. Governance is rocked.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-is-it-important">Why is it Important?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Legacy systems have been brought to the brink by the inability of stakeholders, participants and the public to agree on what is truth.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-does-success-look-like">How does success look like?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Truth about Cardano and ongoing and past events is easy to establish even for newcomers. Trust not being eroded. Transparency is enhanced.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-metrics-to-measure">Key Metrics to measure&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Easier access to information about the Cardano treasury and its funds, treasury disbursement, past, current and future monetary policy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Historical transactions from the treasury and founding entities can be easily identified by any non-power user of Cardano with a couple of clicks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Treasury 101 information sources are established explaining the basics of how the Treasury works and how all Treasury-related facts can be verified independently - with how-to-guides&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Repository of old/new scams, scam attempts, fake debunked theories and falsehoods can be easily checked and accessed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Community-managed websites expand to include more beginner-friendly content about Cardano Treasury, ADA inflation rate, future monetary policy ADA calculators&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Community-managed websites expand to include historical and current content about different types of Cardano scams, bad-faith players, untruths and FUD spreading.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New sources and repositories of information are developed containing timelines for Cardano project, FAQs and criticisms of Cardano as well as answers to criticisms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Better tools for searching and transcribing information from IOG&amp;rsquo;s Cardano 360 shows, Charles Hoskinson&amp;rsquo;s AMAs and from other leading community members are developed.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Disaster recovery (DR) is an area of security planning that aims to protect an organization from the effects of significant negative events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having a disaster recovery strategy in place enables an organization to maintain or quickly resume mission-critical functions following a disruption.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cardano as a proposed financial operating system for the world must have several layers of built in redundancies even for events that may seem remote or very unlikely now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although a testnet exists, real-world conditions can never be fully replicated. Maybe proposers can develop a way of incentivizing further SPO participation in the Cardano testnet and more simulations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Whatever your background, confidently communicating all the important elements of an early stage venture can be overwhelming for inexperienced entrepreneurs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More should be done to help an increasingly diverse group of Project Catalyst entrepreneurs, at different stages of self-development, plus their teams and stakeholders to collaborate and communicate effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is important to Project Catalyst as, over time, the strongest ideas will be those that are the most coherently communicated and which ultimately resonate clearly with voters - particularly Expert evaluators!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This challenge seeks to help inexperienced entrepreneurs to learn and apply vital entrepreneurship skills so they can collaborate with teams and stakeholders on meaningful Catalyst projects. This also helps ensure sustainable impact and a positive return on investment and intention is made.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-is-it-important">Why is it important?&lt;/h2>

&lt;li>of multimedia platforms&lt;/li>
&lt;li>of multilingual teams&lt;/li>

&lt;li>of decentralised news teams&lt;/li>
&lt;li>of decentralised content creation teams&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Creatives, writers, artists, filmmakers, photographers +more, collaborating equitably, can enrich the ecosystem with their cultural diversity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cardano has a strong YouTube community, but obviously YouTube is not everything and it&amp;rsquo;s not received well in many perspectives.
We need a bridge between YouTube, the traditional media, TV and film. We need to communicate a clear message towards media.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to create educational and inspiring content which the national media and TV stations would gladly use in their daily programmes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this early stage, the cooperation between YouTubers and TV &amp;amp; Film professionals is not only welcomed, it&amp;rsquo;s needed.
Creating a specific challenge for this should open the gates for both education and inspiration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Film and Media (FAM) Challenge aims to boost knowledge and adoption of Cardano for global audiences by enabling:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>a challenge platform for the facilitation of professionals and creatives to connect, collaborate and coordinate&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>the launch of projects that spotlight the multitude of stories within the Cardano ecosystem&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>multimedia projects that illustrate how Cardano&amp;rsquo;s blockchain is the &amp;lsquo;green blockchain&amp;rsquo; solution in a world that needs solutions to the climate emergency&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A dedicated challenge category for this creative group to platform their catalysing ideas has been absent thus far.
This has led to potentially impactful projects struggling to find their place in Challenge categories that are not quite the &amp;lsquo;right fit&amp;rsquo;. The FAM challenge category can unlock a flow of submission of ideas and proposals that bring about high quality, educational and inspirational multi-lingual multi-media content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Content that helps build bridges within the Cardano ecosystem and across multi sectoral ecosystems, globally. So FAM creatives, in all corners of the world, step up. You are the ones we have been waiting for.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Catalyst: Fund 7 Challenge Setting</title><link>/catalyst/fund6/challenges/fund7-challenge-setting/campaign-brief/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/catalyst/fund6/challenges/fund7-challenge-setting/campaign-brief/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Security of the network relies on a decentralised pool of SPO&amp;rsquo;s to run it. Without proper support, smaller SPO&amp;rsquo;s will struggle against big players moving in and pushing them out untill they have a majority market share. If these organizations use the same hosting providers for all their infrastructure, this adds additional risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, running nodes and participating in the network can be a great way for community initiatives to support their projects. By supporting and promoting smaller mission focussed SPO&amp;rsquo;s the security of the whole network benefits. Larger hosting providers are also notorious for caring little for their environmental footprint. By promoting SPO&amp;rsquo;s which run on sustainable energy sources we are achieving two goals: A lower ecological footprint of the Cardano network and a more distributed and secure network in terms of infrastructure used.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is not a proposal that needs active work by the proposers, it is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. If it succeeds the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the environmental benefits many of us were born with. Giving them an opportunity to show that circumstances are not something they need charity to rise above and succeed. All that is required is the equal opportunity to succeed or fail that many of the rest of us enjoy, but with their hinderances and hurdles lessened and their choices remaining in their own hands.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="what-does-success-look-like">What does success look like?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Cardano is the blockchain of choice in Africa by 2023.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Throughout human history and civilization, it has been that every few centuries or so a confluence of factors align to transition us from one phase of development to another; The first and second industrial revolutions are prime examples. Right now we are barely out of the Web2 revolution and a fourth Industrial revolution or Web3 is upon us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although Africa did not play a key role in the first, second or third industrial revolution, it is poised to be a leader in Web 3.0 technology and those with foresight are positioning themselves strategically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Cardano community can be one of these visionaries. Let&amp;rsquo;s be serious about seeding long term projects in Africa to capture a large share of an important emerging market.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="rationale-for-budget">Rationale for budget&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s be frank here. We need much more than 250k to continue seeding Cardano in Africa. We are asking for this amount because of Catalyst voting patterns; in that $250k is better than $0 and Wada and Partners can still take advantage of other challenge categories to help expand Cardano in Africa.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Catalyst: Grow East Asia, Grow Cardano</title><link>/catalyst/fund8/challenges/grow-east-asia-grow-cardano/campaign-brief/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/catalyst/fund8/challenges/grow-east-asia-grow-cardano/campaign-brief/</guid><description>

&lt;p>How do we grow the Cardano ecosystem in East Asia in an inclusive and supportive way? The same way we do in Africa, focused initiatives!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-is-it-important">Why is it important?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Cardano community leans heavily toward North America and Europe. Growth elsewhere requires our support and initiative as a community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-does-success-look-like">What does success look like?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A broad spectrum of people across Asia and connected to Asia, coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="key-metrics-to-measure">Key Metrics to measure&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves some questions about the quality of participation:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The number of proposals originating from East Asian participants in Project Catalyst&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The quantity and quality of funded proposals originating from East Asian teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The observed impact of funded projects (meeting their KPIs).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Did we increase the participation of the Cardano community and Catalyst teams with East Asian residents?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Was there an increase in Daily/Monthly Active Wallets (DAW/MAW) as a proxy measure of momentum and engagement&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Did we increase the number of Stake Pools and Stake Pool Operators based in East Asia?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will also be asking some specific questions about the quality of the proposals:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is there good feedback on funded project progress, failure or success, that help us understand the nuances of deploying Cardano solutions across East Asia?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is the novelty and appropriateness of solutions?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are we on track to improve the lives of people using Cardano in East Asia?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Was social and environmental impact evaluation used to measure proposal performance?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is the sustainability of proposals beyond the scope of Catalyst?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenge-brief">Challenge Brief&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As in Africa, raising the awareness levels of regular people in East Asia about blockchain and the Cardano network should be a priority for the Catalyst community. In this challenge, we provide funding for people who have learned about Cardano to take advantage of the community&amp;rsquo;s support and build on or use the Cardano network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nature of the proposals for this challenge is open-ended. Their only requirement is to originate or focus on East Asia and include east Asian team members or focus on East Asian participants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For instance, the overwhelming majority of Stake Pools reside in North America and Europe. The Cardano network will be more resilient when Stake Pools are evenly distributed across the globe. The Catalyst community needs to step up and intentionally make that happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cardano started life in East Asia (Japan and Hong Kong), and Emurgo focuses on East Asia. Let&amp;rsquo;s build upon that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What this is:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A call to action; Activate the Cardano community&amp;rsquo;s ability to recognise, reward the opportunity to make the world a better place. East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Addressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. When the challenge succeeds, the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the benefits many of us were born with—allowing others with fewer privileged circumstances to rise and succeed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Catalyst: Grow India, Grow Cardano</title><link>/catalyst/fund8/challenges/grow-india-grow-cardano/campaign-brief/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/catalyst/fund8/challenges/grow-india-grow-cardano/campaign-brief/</guid><description>

&lt;p>How can we grow Cardano development and adoption in India?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-is-it-important">Why is it important?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>1.4B people. 55% under 30y (2016 est)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Local Cardano developers/businesses needed to solve local issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Significant poverty/unbanked&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-does-success-look-like">What does success look like?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Success is having multiple submissions for Catalyst Fund8 for India focused projects, with real-world projects getting funded and built.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="key-metrics-to-measure">Key Metrics to measure&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The overall key metrics would be:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Increased interaction between Catalyst and Indian focused projects&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Number of Indian focused Catalyst submissions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Number of Indian focused dapps/services actually built&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="challenge-brief">Challenge Brief&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As well as Africa, I think we should also put significant focus on Cardano within India.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>India has a massive population of 1.4 billion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>55% are under the age of 30yrs (Wikipedia, 2016 est.) There are a significant percentage of unbanked/rural people worldpoverty.io notes 100 million Indians (7%) live in extreme poverty Certain rural areas are already using Aadhaar Pay to pay for goods using their fingerprint see &lt;a href="https://www.payaadhar">https://www.payaadhar&lt;/a>. In 2019). So there is enough infrastructure and consumer devices in place to make this a serious market right away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having an India focused Catalyst challenge/fund would be very useful to gather teams and ideas and get the Cardano ball rolling in India. I am not Indian and have no connection to India, but I think that Cardano could be useful to help solve issues that they face and also to grow the Cardano eco-system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the surface issues in India might appear similar to Africa or South America, and there will be some overlap, but ideally local people identifying and solving local issues is best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Emurgo has an office in India, but not sure what they are up to. IT in India is well established with a large pool of talent and skills available - we need to let them know about Cardano and the Catalyst funding. This proposal is intended to focus on India within a Fund8 challenge, with that challenge attracting actionable proposals to grow the community of developers and educators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some suggestions for that Fund8 challenge are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Setting up local Cardano hubs for regular catch ups (virtual or real world)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Local-language websites/socials/YT set up to attract developers/entrepreneurs to explain Cardano and Catalyst at a high-level&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fund a dapp and create a how-to video in local-language as a walk through to help educate and reduce perceived complexity&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Run a competition/pitch-fest for dapp ideas with the top 10 ideas get funded to make a MVP&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Connect with universities and training centers&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Connect with new and established Indian YouTube channels to talk Cardano tech, dev ideas, business opportunities etc to create a buzz about Catalyst funding&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Regularly promote awareness of Cardano and Catalyst funding to bring people into the space eg a 12 month campaign&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is like a big heavy wheel that will take a lot of energy to get turning, but once it starts to move it will (hopefully) keep going with less energy needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How much ADA/USD should be available for this proposal?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think it will take a few Catalyst rounds to build the Cardano interest in India, so the first round of investment during Fund8 should be $150k. Subsequent funding rounds can be determined at the time and then voted on by the community.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Catalyst: Grow Latin America, Grow Cardano</title><link>/catalyst/fund7/challenges/grow-latin-america/campaign-brief/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/catalyst/fund7/challenges/grow-latin-america/campaign-brief/</guid><description>

&lt;p>As in Africa, raising the awareness levels of regular people in Latin America about blockchain technology and the Cardano protocol should be a priority for the Catalyst community. Providing the funding for those people who learn about our protocol to take advantage of the protocol and the support the community offers seems to be why we work together, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within our community we have some outstanding people from Latin America working with us to grow the ecosystem. Let&amp;rsquo;s give our fellow community members a funding category they can point to within their local communities as a means to take part in this revolution of technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The overwhelming majority of stake pools are based in North America and Europe. The Cardano protocol will be much more resilient and productive for people all around the world when the Catalyst community steps up and intentionally supports those who would like become a part of the stake pool network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the Catalyst community&amp;rsquo;s original members come from Latin America, let&amp;rsquo;s capitalize on that initiative and bring more people from this wonderful part of the world into the Cardano ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-is-it-important">Why is it Important?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Cardano community is heavily based in North America and Europe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Growth elsewhere requires our support and initiative as a community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-does-success-look-like">How does success look like?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A wide spectrum of people from Latin America or with connections to Latin America coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-metrics-to-measure">Key Metrics to measure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Basic metrics to look for to determine the effectivity of this challenge will include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The volume of proposals originated by Latin Americans participating in Project Catalyst.
-The quality of those proposals as well as the impact on their local communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Did we attract new members of the community from Latin American countries?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Will we see an increase in transactions processed (blocks minted) in Latin America? New SPOs forming?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What can we learn from funded proposals when it comes to building on the initial successfully funded proposals from this challenge setting?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Will applications be developed that might be useful in other parts of the world?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Will there be measurable improvement in the lives of people who are attracted to the Cardano ecosystem?&lt;/li>

&lt;p>How to make the auditing process of funded proposals efficient, distributed and transparent?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fund Size: &lt;strong>$100,000 USD paid in Ada&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When Fund7 happens we will be close to 100 funded proposals. It is extremely important that these proposals are evaluated/audited to see if they are delivering and if the ROI is being in line with what has been established initialy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, IOG is in charge of monitoring the development of these funded proposals, but when there are hundreds of funded proposals this will be an overwhelming work for IOG.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Auditability challenge aims to ensure transparency in the use of Cardano&amp;rsquo;s treasury resources, which will allow the Cardano community to have more information on the development of funded proposals through a checks and balances system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some directions that this challenge can take:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Podcasts with teams from funded proposals.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Smart contract audits.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Platforms / Websites that perform:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Reporting on metrics, spending of financial resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Metrics on the development of Dapps (txs, volume, unique wallets, etc …)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Metrics on Number of onboarded developers, number of commits in funded proposal repositories.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Social media engagement indicators metrics.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="why-is-it-important">Why is it important?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s important that the funded proposals are evaluated to see if they are delivering what was established in their mission..&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-does-success-look-like">How does success look like?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Several projects evaluating funded proposals, providing reports, articles and metrics on the development and implementation of the projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-metrics-to-measure">Key Metrics to measure&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="number-of-funded-proposals-audited">Number of funded proposals audited&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Considering that the idea is to audit and report on the development of proposals in different challenges, it is important that success metrics are thought out in relation to each challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="number-of-reports-articles-and-videospodcasts-on">Number of reports, articles and videos/podcasts on:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>

&lt;li>Number of onboarded developers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Number of commits in funded proposal repositories (Github)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Indicators of: transactions, volume and unique wallets interacting with dapps.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Number of smart contracts audited.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Social media engagement indicators.&lt;/li>
